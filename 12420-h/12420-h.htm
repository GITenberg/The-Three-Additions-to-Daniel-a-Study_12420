<h3>Preface</h3>

<p>The three apocryphal portions of Daniel considered in this book have
often been hardly judged. One of them had almost become a byword of
contempt for fabulous inventiveness. Yet the writer hopes that he has
succeeded in shewing that they are worthy of more serious attention than
they have frequently received. The prejudice long existing in this
country against the Apocrypha as a whole has told heavily against two at
any rate of these booklets; and he who attempts to investigate the
nature and origin of the Additions to Daniel finds himself following a
track which is anything but well beaten. The number of commentaries or
treatises in English dealing directly with these works is very small.
Indeed, considering the position accorded to them by the Church, it is
surprisingly so. And of those which exist, some are not very valuable
for accurate study. Hence, in preparing a treatise of this kind,
materials have to be quarried and brought <a class="pagenum" title="x" id="pagex"></a>together from varied and
distant sources; and the work, small as its result may be in size, has
proved a laborious one. The conclusions arrived at on many points are
but provisional; for the writer thinks that the day has not yet come
when the source and place of these Additions to Daniel can be surely and
incontrovertibly fixed. It is to be hoped that further evidence and
longer study will eventually make these matters clearer than they are at
present. Meanwhile, careful and unprejudiced work upon the subject, by
whomsoever undertaken, cannot but tend towards that goal; and the author
trusts that he may have contributed something which will help, at least
a little, towards the solution of the difficult problem presented.</p>

<p>The Song of the Three and the Histories of Susanna and of Bel and the
Dragon are most interesting memorials of the spirit of their time,
though that time may be difficult to fix precisely. And when looked at
from the religious point of view they are replete with valuable moral
lessons for &quot;example of life and instruction of manners,&quot; to borrow the
terms which the Sixth Article of Religion <a class="pagenum" title="xi" id="pagexi"></a>employs with regard to the
Apocryphal books. An attempt has been made, in a concluding chapter on
each book, to draw some of these lessons out, so that they may be easily
available for such homiletic and other purposes as are contemplated in
that Article.</p>

<p>The study of these three pieces supplementary to Daniel has convinced
the writer that they are of more value than has been generally supposed,
and are worthy of the attention of biblical scholars in a much higher
degree than that which has usually been accorded to them. If he has in
any way helped in providing materials, or in suggesting ideas, which may
fructify in abler hands, he will be rewarded for the researches he has
made.</p>

<p>It appears to him that there is much connected with these books which we
are unable now fully to discover; much about which it is unwise to
dogmatize; many questions which must be treated as open ones; many
problems which can at most only receive provisional solutions, till
further facts are elicited and further insight given. The time is
apparently still distant when the origin and true <a class="pagenum" title="xii" id="pagexii"></a>standing of these
Additions can be certainly assigned to them: for, at the present,
agreement amongst Christians on these points shews but little sign of
being arrived at. Yet we trust that the time will come when deeper
knowledge will make it possible for disputed points to be settled. &quot;The
patience of the godly shall not be frustrate&quot; (Ecclus. xvi. 13).</p>

<p>In conclusion I must record my hearty thanks to Dr. Sinker, Librarian of
Trinity College, Cambridge, for the great assistance he has given me in
correcting the proof-sheets, as well as for his constant kindness in
many other ways, of which these words are but an insufficient
acknowledgment.</p>

<div id="part1" class="part">

<h2>Part I</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
</div>

<div id="intro" class="chapter">
<a class="pagenum" title="3" id="page3"></a>
<h2>Introduction.</h2>

<p>These Additions differ from the other Apocryphal books, except the &quot;rest
of&quot; Esther, in not claiming to be separate works, but appearing as
supplements to a canonical book. The Song of the Three Children takes
its assumed place between vv. 23 and 24 of Dan. iii.; the History of
Susanna in the language of the A.V. is &quot;set apart from the beginning of
Daniel&quot;; and Bel and the Dragon is &quot;cut off from the end of&quot; the same
book. The first of these additions alone has an organic connection with
the main narrative; the other two are independent scenes from the life,
or what purports to be the life, of Daniel&mdash;episodes, one in his
earlier, one in his later, career. In the Song, Daniel personally does
not appear at all; in Susanna and in Bel he plays a conspicuous part; in
Susanna appearing as a sort of 'deus ex machina' to set things right at
the end; and in Bel he is an essential actor in the whole story.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="4" id="page4"></a>It is hoped to shew, amongst other things, that the dissimilarity
supposed to exist between these additions and the rest of Daniel is by
no means so great as has sometimes been imagined. The opinion of one of
the latest commentators on Daniel (Marti, T&uuml;bingen, 1901, p. xx) may be
taken as a fair sample of this view. He thinks these pieces by no means
congruous with the canonical Daniel: &quot;Den Abstand dieser apokryphischen
Erz&auml;hlungen von dem in hebraram. Dan. aufgenommen Volkstradition kann
niemand verkennen.&quot; So far as these additions to the contents of Daniel
are concerned, he would agree with the exaggerated statement of Trommius
as to all the Apocrypha: &quot;ad libros canonicos S. Scriptur&aelig; proprie non
pertinent nec cum Gr&aelig;ca eorum versione quicquam commune habent,&quot; etc.
(<i>Concord. Pr&aelig;f.</i> &sect; xi.). The sharp distinction drawn by J.M. Fuller
also between the style and thought of these additions, and of the
canonical Daniel, is far too strong: &quot;as clearly marked as between the
canonical and apocryphal gospels.&quot; Few will think the separation between
them so wide as this (<i>Speaker's Comm. Introd. to Dan.</i> p. 221a).
Moreover, they are much less obviously incongruous, less plainly meant
for edifying &quot;improvements&quot; by a later hand, than the Additions to
Esther.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="5" id="page5"></a>But beyond the connection, more or less strong, which these pieces have
with the canonical book, they have also a connection, by means of
certain similar features, with one another. All have this in common,
viz. the celebration or record of some deliverance. God's persecuted
people are rescued from mortal danger. In the first and third cases they
suffer at the hands of idolaters; in the second, of Jewish
co-religionists. In each case they provide us with a scene from
Israelitish life &quot;in a strange land.&quot; They are tales of the Babylonian
Captivity.</p>

<p>In each story the ministry of angels, giving aid against visible foes,
takes a prominent place; though in Susanna these appearances are
suppressed in Theodotion's version, an angel, however, being just
mentioned in Daniel's sentences of condemnation. In each case too there
is distinct progress under God's guiding hand; things are left much
better at the end than at the beginning. There is a tone of confidence,
bred of sure conviction, in one abundantly expressed, in the others
latent, as to the ultimate triumph of right. They agree in the certainty
of God's defence, and shew complete reliance on Him. The Captivity had
done a purifying work.</p>

<p>These stories of rescue from oppressors would <a class="pagenum" title="6" id="page6"></a>be specially acceptable
to the Jews of the Babylonian Captivity; more so probably than to the
Jews of the Dispersion elsewhere. Howbeit they are records of zeal and
trust which have moved many hearts in all ages and places.</p>

<p>In the last two Daniel appears as a person of great knowledge and power,
successfully acting under the Divine guidance. In all three there is
little which can properly be called strained or far-fetched. Almost
everything is drawn naturally from what we may presume would be the
condition of Daniel's time. Both behind and through the details of the
stories we can see the heart of one who praised God, loved justice, and
hated idolatry; who took delight in what was noble, pure, and truthful,
and waged a successful warfare with whatever he encountered of an
opposite character.</p>

<p>Each piece, moreover, has what may be thought to be its own allusion or
reminiscence in the New Testament. And each of these parallels,
curiously enough, seems eminently characteristic of the addition whence
it may have been taken.</p>

<p>Thus we find in the parallel of St. Matt, xxvii. 24 with Susanna 46 the
assertion of innocency in respect of miscarriage of justice; in that of
Heb. xii. 23 with the Song 64 (86), the utterance of the spirits and
<a class="pagenum" title="7" id="page7"></a>souls of the righteous; and in that of Acts xvii. 23 with Bel and
Dragon 27, the mocker of idols.</p>

<p>One is from the beginning, one from the midst, one from the end of the
Greek Daniel; the first by St. Matthew reporting Pilate; the second by a
writer not certainly identified; the third by St. Luke reporting St.
Paul. These may be merely accidental resemblances, but their occurrence
in this way is curious, and worthy of consideration.</p>

<p>As to the position of these pieces, whether in or out of the canon, it
is probable, speaking generally, that those who used the Hebrew Bible,
or versions uninfluenced by the LXX, disregarded them as not being part
of Holy Scripture; and that those who used the LXX, or its versions,
accepted them, either with or without hesitation. Under the chapters
entitled &quot;Early Christian Literature&quot; it will be seen that those were by
no means wanting who appear to attribute in practical use canonical
authority to each fragment; and at least what Otto St&auml;helin says of
Clement of Alexandria, that he &quot;nicht geringer sch&auml;tzte,&quot; may be held
true of nearly all the Fathers who name them (<i>Clem. Alex, und LXX</i>,
N&uuml;rnberg, 1901, p. 74). It is, however, surprising that this divergence
of use, in so important a matter as the extent of the canon, did <a class="pagenum" title="8" id="page8"></a>not
give rise to a more general controversy. What discussion there was on
this question lay chiefly between a few scholarly individuals, who
treated the matter as of private and personal, almost as much as of
public, interest.</p>

<p>Even if it were admitted that these works were not in the Hebrew canon,
the question is still not absolutely settled. For it might be contended,
without at all asserting that the Hebrew canon was erroneous or
deficient in its time, that these and other apocryphal works were
reserved in the providence of God for the Christian Church to deal with
as she thought fit. Nor is it clear that her powers as to them, when
deciding for canonicity or no, were of necessity more restricted than
her powers as to the N.T. books on the same question. What Tertullian
says with regard to 'Enoch' might be extended to other books, &quot;Scio
scripturam Enoch... non recipi a quibusdam quia nec in armarium
Judaicum admittitur... a vobis quidem nihil omnino rejiciendum est quod
pertinent ad nos&quot; (<i>De cult. f&aelig;m.</i> I. 13).</p>

<p>The title 'Daniel,' it should be observed, in lists of Scripture books,
often covers these additions; as for example in Origen's list, as
preserved by Eusebius, <i>H.E.</i> vi. 25. For we know that Origen (<i>Ep. ad
Afric.</i>) defended these additions, and so almost <a class="pagenum" title="9" id="page9"></a>certainly intended
this title to include them. So also with Athanasius and Cyril of
Jerusalem'(<i>see</i> Sus. 'Canonicity,' p. 160). Probably it is on this
account that Loisy (<i>O.T. Canon</i>, Paris, 1890, p. 97) says that
Athanasius received &quot;certainement les fragments de Daniel, sur la foi
des Septante, comme le font Orig&egrave;ne et tous les P&egrave;res grecs.&quot;</p>

<p>Ecclesiastical practice, as well as their distribution amongst the
canonical books of both Greek and Latin Bibles, told, as time went on,
more and more in favour of their inclusion.</p>

<p>But they were not officially recognized as on a level in all respects
with Holy Scripture, even by the Roman Church, till the fourth session
of the Council of Trent (1546), when they were all placed on an equality
with, in fact treated as portions of, the book of Daniel. Probably the
phrase &quot;libros integros <i>cum omnibus suis partibus</i>&quot; was introduced into
the decree with special reference to these additions and those to
Esther. This decree, making them &quot;sacred and canonical,&quot; was carried,
according to Loisy (p. 201), by 44 placets to 3 non-placets and 5
doubtful.<a id="fnt1" href="#fn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Dr. Streane, however, says (<i>Age of the Maccabees,</i> 1898,
p. 102) it was passed by &quot;a small majority.&quot; Even writers so late as
Nicholas de <a class="pagenum" title="10" id="page10"></a>Lyra (&#8224;1340) and Denys the Carthusian (&#8224;1471) speak of
these additions as true, but not parts of Holy Scripture (Loisy, p. 223,
quoting Corn. &agrave; Lap. on Dan. xiii. 3). And they were of the Roman
obedience.</p>

<div class="note" id="fn1">
<p><a href="#fnt1">[1]</a> He refers to Theiner, <i>Acta ... concil. Trident</i>, i. 77.</p>
</div>

<p>Bleek (<i>Introd. to O.T.</i> II. 336, Eng. tr.) says that the seventh decree
of the Council of Florence (1439), making mention of apocryphal books as
canonical, which no one was acquainted with before the Tridentine
Council, is very probably not genuine. Denys the Carthusian, it will be
observed, was subsequent to the supposed Florentine decree, and
seemingly ignorant of its existence.</p>

<p>The same writer states (pp. 336, 339) that while Karlstadt classed some
of the Apocrypha as &quot;hagiographa extra canonem,&quot; he called these
supplements to Daniel, with the Prayer of Manasses, and others as &quot;plane
apocryphos.&quot; He also represents Luther as prettily styling these pieces
corn-flowers plucked up, because not in the Hebrew, yet placed in a
separate garden or bed, because much that is good is found in them. They
are thus detached in his version, as in ours, from Daniel, and placed
among the apocryphal books. Calvin, however, in his Lectures on Daniel
entirely ignores these additions. His English translator barely mentions
them in his preface (Edinb. 1852, p. xlix.).</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="11" id="page11"></a>Far more contemptuous than Luther's estimate of these productions is
that of Professor (now Bishop) Ryle in the <i>Cambridge Companion to the
Bible</i> (1894), where he writes: &quot;The character of these stories is
trifling and childish.&quot;</p>

<p>But in reply to this and similar depreciatory opinions, it may be
pointed out that one does not look in these extra-Danielic stories for
such a knowledge of the human heart as is displayed in the Psalms, nor
for such knowledge of the Godhead as is revealed in St. John's Gospel.
If we look for fully developed doctrine of this kind, we shall no doubt
be disappointed. But we do find religious teaching after the tenor of
the old covenant, such as might be expected in compositions which are
mainly narrative; we meet with teaching which looks quite as clear as
that, say, of the books of Ruth, Chronicles, or Esther. Indeed, those
who have a mind to draw moral and spiritual instruction from these brief
works will not find it difficult to do so, or discover that the
religious teaching is out of harmony with that which is acknowledged to
exist in Daniel (<i>see</i> chaps, on &quot;Example of Life and Instruction of
Manners&quot;). In point of fact, an overgrowth of unreasonable objections
has been too much encouraged; and if these pieces may not in all
respects secure a favourable vote, it is <a class="pagenum" title="12" id="page12"></a>desirable that they may
receive at least an unprejudiced and equitable judgment.</p>

<p>The examples of patristic use given under the head of &quot;Early Christian
Literature&quot; will, it is hoped, sufficiently refute such statements as
that of Albert Barnes (<i>Daniel,</i> Lond. 1853, pp. 79, 80): &quot;It is seldom
that these additions to Daniel are quoted or alluded to at all by the
early Christian writers, but when they are, it is only that they may be
condemned.&quot; This may be taken as a specimen of a certain class of
adverse opinion, evidently formed without sufficient investigation of
the subject. In reality, these pieces are referred to, considering their
brevity, with surprising frequency; that the references are not
exclusively, or even generally, for purposes of condemnation, hardly
needs to be stated.</p>

<p>What effect these writings took on Jewish readers there is little or
nothing to shew. With the rest of the LXX, they seem to have lost ground
with Jews as they gained it with Christians. The closing scene of Bel
and the Dragon, however, is made use of in <i>Breshith Rabba</i> to
illustrate Joseph's abandonment in the pit (Gen. xxxvii.)<a id="fnt2" href="#fn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. To
Christians indeed they have, from a very early date, constantly
presented <a class="pagenum" title="13" id="page13"></a>themselves as highly valuable for purposes of edification.
Nor, with the possible exception of Susanna, is it easy to see in what
way they could have furthered, in that aspect, any undesirable end.</p>

<p>What will be the future of these pieces by which, in the Greek Bible,
the contents of Daniel were increased? It is not easy to say. Much will
surely depend on the eventual consensus of opinion as to the date of
that book itself. Neither the Roman nor Greek Churches shew any sign of
modifying their entire,<a id="fnt3" href="#fn3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> or very slightly qualified, acceptance of
these additions as integral parts of Holy Scripture. On the other hand,
English-speaking Protestant Dissenters shew almost as little sign of
rising to any religious appreciation of them.</p>

<div class="note" id="fn3">
<p><a href="#fnt3">[3]</a> The Vatican Council confirmed the Tridentine decree on Scripture
(<i>Const.</i> &quot;Dei Filius&quot; II., Loisy, p. 239).</p>
</div>

<p>Between these extremes the Church of England, and perhaps the German and
Scandinavian Lutherans, hold, as to these books, an intermediate
position, which in this, as in some other questions, may not improbably
prove to be the right one. In any case the English Church has always
treated them with great respect, a large part of one of them entering
into her Morning Prayer, and the other two having been appointed as
first lessons in her calendar from <a class="pagenum" title="14" id="page14"></a>1549 to 1872, except that Bel and
the Dragon was removed from 1604 to 1662. Previous to this last date
they were read, not as independent books, but as Dan. xiii. and xiv.</p>

<p>A patient waiting for the production of further evidence as to the
origin and position of these additions can hardly be unrewarded.
Meanwhile we may fitly agree with St. Gregory of Nazianzus' lines, which
apply as well to these as to the other books of the Apocrypha:</p>

<h3>The Song of the Three Holy Children</h3>

<div id="part2_0" class="section">
<h4>Analysis.</h4>

<p>vv.</p>

<p>1, 2. Narrative in continuation of the canonical text, describing
the procedure of the three children in the furnace.</p>

<p>3-22. Azarias' confession (3-10), and prayer (11-22), on behalf
of them all.</p>

<p>23-28. Narrative describing the fire, the descent of the Angel, and
the happy result.</p>

<p>29-68. The Song of praise itself, which may be subdivided thus: God
directly addressed in blessing (29-34); after all God's works,
celestial objects are addressed, including Angels<a id="fnt4" href="#fn4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> (35-41); objects
of the lower heaven or atmosphere are called upon, including those
immediately concerned, wind and dew being placed next to fire and heat
(42-51); then the earth<a id="fnt5" href="#fn5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> and its natural features, and the animals
inhabiting it, are called upon (52-59); then the human race, as a whole
and in various classes, down to the three children themselves (60-66).
In conclusion God is extolled for His ever-enduring mercy in phrases
culled from the Psalter (67, 68).</p>

<div id="fn4" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt4">[4]</a> &quot;The first and most gifted of creatures&quot; (M'Swiney,
<i>Psalms and
Canticles</i>, 1901, p. 644).</p>
</div>

<div id="fn5" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt5">[5]</a> Perhaps in default of better explanation the &quot;earth&quot;
verse may have
been put into the third person in order to mark the transition from
things celestial to those terrestrial.</p>
</div>

<p>The tendency of the arrangement of the Song proper is to descend from
generals to particulars. It has a refrain at the end of each verse,
slightly differing in those preliminary verses which <a class="pagenum" title="18" id="page18"></a>are addressed to
the Lord Himself, and wanting in the last three. The rendering of the
refrain in the preliminary verses does not seem very happy in its
English (A.V. and K.V.).</p>
</div>

<div id="part2_1" class="section">
<h4>Title And Position.</h4>

<h5>Title.</h5>

<p>Forming, as it does, an integral portion of the third chapter of the
Greek Daniel, the principal MSS. give the Song, in that place, no
independent title. It falls of course under the general title of the
whole Book, Daniel.</p>

<p>Van Ess in his LXX (Lips. 1835) entitles it <span xml:lang="el">&#928;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#965;&#967;&#8052; &#7944;&#950;&#945;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#8021;&#956;&#957;&#959;&#962;
&#964;&#8182;&#957; &#964;&#961;&#953;&#8182;&#957;</span>, but as he puts this heading in curved brackets it is possibly
merely his own insertion. 'B' is the codex which he is professing to
follow in his text; but that MS. is credited with no such title in Dr.
Swete's Greek Old Testament; nor do Holmes and Parsons shew any
knowledge of it as existing in any of their MSS.</p>

<p>In the Veronese Graeco-Latin Psalter it is headed <span xml:lang="el">&#8029;&#956;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#969;&#957;
&#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span>, and in the Turin Psalter <span xml:lang="el">&#8029;&#956;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#964;&#961;&#953;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#8182;&#957;</span>, which title it
inserts again at v. 57, strangely regarding that verse as the
commencement of a fresh canticle with a new number, <span xml:lang="el">&#953;&#946;</span>. Churton (<i>Uncan.
and Apocr. Script.</i>, p. 391) suggests that the former title &quot;may have
been wrongly <a class="pagenum" title="19" id="page19"></a>transferred from Ecclus. xliv.&quot; at the head of which it
stands. He also calls it the title in the Alexandrian Psalter&mdash;the Odes,
presumably that is, at the end. But the title to Ecclus. xliv. is simply
<span xml:lang="el">&#960;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#969;&#957; &#8021;&#956;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>, so that the likelihood of the transfer, deemed possible
by Churton, having taken place is very small.</p>

<p>In the Odes, at the end of Cod. A, two canticles are extracted from this
piece; the first (Ode IX.) entitled <span xml:lang="el">&#928;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#965;&#967;&#8052; &#7944;&#950;&#945;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965;</span>, the second (Ode
X.) <span xml:lang="el">&#8029;&#956;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#960;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#969;&#957; &#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span>, each corresponding with the name given to
it. In the office of Eastern Lauds the two parts have separate titles,
being assigned to different days of the week (<i>D.C.A.</i> art. <i>Canticle</i>).</p>

<p>In the Syriac and Arabic versions of Daniel a separate title is given
after v. 23 of chap. iii., and in the latter after v. 52, according
to Churton in his marginal notes. He also says that &quot;the prayer of the
companions of <i>Ananias</i>&quot; is the Syriac title. The titles on the whole
are fairly suited to their purpose; but the use of the word &quot;children&quot;
(<span xml:lang="el">&#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#8182;&#957;</span>) in the common heading of the Song contemplates the three as of
the age indicated in Daniel i. rather than that in Daniel iii.</p>


<h5>Position.</h5>

<p>Obviously this is not meant for an independent work, since it has no
proper commencement of its <a class="pagenum" title="20" id="page20"></a>own. &quot;And they walked&quot; is clearly intended
as a continuation of some foregoing history. Accordingly, its position
in the LXX, Theodotion, Vulgate, and other versions, is immediately
after the 23rd verse of Daniel iii., thus forming a portion of that
chapter. This is clearly its natural and appropriate place. It unites
well both at the beginning and the end with the canonical text, &quot;Qui se
trouve entrelass&eacute;e (<i>sic</i>) dans le texte,&quot; as D. Martin says in the
heading of the book in his French version. T.H. Home, however (<i>Introd.</i>
1856, II. 936), mentions its &quot;abrupt nature&quot; as a reason for thinking
that the translator did not invent it, but made use of already existing
materials. But the abruptness is not so apparent to other eyes and ears.
Indeed G. Jahn, in his note on Dan. iii. 24 (Leipzig, 1904), considers
the gap between vv. 23 and 24 in the Massoretic text is filled up
satisfactorily in the LXX and Theodotion only.</p>

<p>By means of this insertion, and the inclusion of what in A.V. are the
first four verses of chap. iv., this chapter is lengthened out in the
Greek and Latin versions to exactly 100 verses.</p>

<p>Bishop Gray's note (<i>Key to O.T.</i> 1797, p. 608), in which he says &quot;the
Song of the three holy children is not in the Vat. copy of the LXX,&quot; is
certainly a mistake. It is just possible, however, that he may <a class="pagenum" title="21" id="page21"></a>have
meant that the true LXX version was absent from it. So Ball somewhat
obscurely (p. 310 &quot;the Alex. MS. omits&quot;<a id="fnt6" href="#fn6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>), and Bissell (p. 442),
though not very distinctly, suggest a like idea as to its omission from
Dan. iii. in A, and Z&ouml;ckler in his commentary falls into the same
mistake (Munich, 1891, p. 231). It is not unlikely that these writers
successively influenced each other.</p>

<div id="fn6" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt6">[6]</a> This may refer to the titles he gives from &quot;the Vatican
LXX&quot;; but
see above, p. 18, as to the absence of these.</p>
</div>

<p>E. Philippe's idea (Vigouroux, <i>Dict.</i> II. 1267a), that this piece was
separated from the original book because &quot;elle retarde le r&eacute;cit et est
en dehors du but final&quot; seems unconvincing&mdash;as much so as Dereser's
(quoted in Bissell, p. 444), from whom perhaps it was borrowed&mdash;that
&quot;the Sanhedrim at Jerusalem shortened it for convenient use,&quot; An equally
unsatisfying &quot;reason&quot; is that of H. Deane in <i>Daniel, his Life and
Times</i>, p. 70 (pref. 1888). &quot;There is no doubt as to the antiquity of
this addition, but probably on account of the feelings of hatred the
three children express with regard to their enemies, it was not
universally received by the Church.&quot; In the face of many stronger
expressions in the O.T. received without hesitation, this explanation
seems untenable, or at least insufficient. And the same <a class="pagenum" title="22" id="page22"></a>may be said of
G. Jahn's theory that some mention of the singing of the three,
contained in the original, was expunged by the Massoretes as too
wonderful and apocryphal.</p>

<p>Much has been made of the omission of this and the other additions from
the original Syriac (<i>e.g.</i> Westcott, quoting Polychronius, Smith's
<i>D.B.</i>, ed. 2. 7136, Bissell, 448), but they are contained in the Syriac
text of Origen's <i>Hexapla</i>, in the MS. in the Ambrosian Library at Milan
(Kautzsch, I. 172), published in facsimile by Ceriani. Bugati in his
edition of Daniel gives this Syriac and the LXX text in parallel
columns. In Jephet Ibn All's (the Karaite's) Arabic commentary on
Daniel, translated by D.S. Margoliouth (Oxf. 1889), no notice is taken
of the additions. The commentary was probably written about A.D. 1000.</p>

<p>Professor Rothstein (Kautzsch, I. 173) compares the situation of the
prayer in ix. 4 <i>sqq.</i>, which he deems, like this one, to have been
perhaps a later insertion into the book.</p>

<p>It is beyond question that if this psalm of prayer and praise is to find
a place anywhere in the Book of Daniel, no more suitable position can be
found for it than that which it occupies so well in the Greek. If it is
a digression from the course of the <a class="pagenum" title="23" id="page23"></a>original narrative it is very
happily placed, since it accounts satisfactorily for the statement &quot;the
king was astonied&quot; in v. 24 (91). He was surprised at the voice of
praise, instead of the shrieks of pain which he had expected to produce
by the execution of his decree.</p>
</div>

<div id="part2_2" class="section">
<h4>Authorship.</h4>

<p>In the Greek of neither &#927;&#8189; nor &#920; is there variation sufficient to prove
that the writer differed from the one who translated the rest of the
book. Rather do the indications point to the same hand having been at
work throughout. Comely says of this and its companion pieces, &quot;Neque in
trium pericoparum argumentis quidquam invenitur quo illas Danielis
auctori attribuere prohibeamur&quot; (<i>Compendium,</i> Paris, 1889, p. 421).
This, like other R.C. writings, holds of course a brief for their
canonicity.</p>

<p>The Prayer, on the surface, claims to be by Azarias; the Song by all the
three. The introductory and intermediate narrative verses are given as
if from the same pen as the rest of Daniel's history; v. 4 (27)
reminds us in its terms of Daniel iv. 37 (34) very strongly, and, in
part, of ix. 14. In v. 24 (47) the mention of 49 (7 x 7) is paralleled
by the symbolic use of the number 7 in iv. 25, etc. But even if, as is
likely, they did not originate with the ostensible <a class="pagenum" title="24" id="page24"></a>utterers, still it
is quite possible that the hand for the prayer, the narrative, and the
Song may not, in the first instance, have been identical.</p>

<p>Probably, however, we are intended, by the producer of the piece in its
present shape, to understand that the prayer and the Song are recorded,
even if not originated, by the author of the whole book. If not genuine
parts of Daniel, their parentage has not been assigned to any named
author; and the work must be treated as anonymous, for no clue has been
traced which points to a definite writer.</p>

<p>The putting forward in v. 2 (25) of the second person of the trio, not
otherwise distinguished from his fellows, is remarkable, and not
suggestive of a forgery. There is nothing to shew why he led the prayer,
as no special characteristics are attached to Abed-nego in our
knowledge. Most likely a forger would have put the prayer into the mouth
of Shadrach (Ananias), who always stands first, though the order of the
last two is reversed in the one place in which the three are named in
the uncanonical portion of the chapter. Ewald (<i>Hist. of Israel</i>, E. Tr.
Lond. 1874, V. 486) thinks that Azarias is introduced as the eldest, or
perhaps the teacher, of the other two; but this conjecture does not
account for the varying orders of the names of the three in v. 65.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="25" id="page25"></a>However thick a veil may rest over the author's name, it may safely be
regarded as certain that he was a Jew, and a Jew who was well acquainted
with the Psalter. But the opinion as to whether he was of Babylonian,
Palestinian, or Alexandrian extraction will depend in a great measure on
the view taken as to the original language, whether Chaldee, Hebrew, or
Greek. Professor Rothstein (p. 174) admits the possibility of this
addition having been made to Daniel before its translation into Greek.
But Dean W.R.W. Stephens (<i>Helps to Study of P.B.</i>, Oxf. n. d., prob.
1901, p. 45) may be taken as representing what has been the commonest
view. He thinks it &quot;probably composed by an Alexandrine Jew.&quot; On the
other hand, Dr. Streane's remark tells against this increase of contents
having begun at Alexandria. &quot;The tendency to diffuseness, characteristic
of later Judaism... operated much more slightly among Egyptian Jews
than with their brethren elsewhere&quot; (quoted in Dr. Swete's <i>Introd. to
Greek O.T.</i>, p. 259).</p>

<p>The assertion has gone the round of the commentators that the Song
proper is a mere expansion of Psalm cxlviii., leaving us to infer that
it is hardly a work of independent authorship. Perowne<a id="fnt7" href="#fn7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> writes, <a class="pagenum" title="26" id="page26"></a>&quot;the
earliest imitation of this psalm is the Song of the Three Children.&quot; And
J.H. Blunt, <i>in loc.</i>, tells us that &quot;the hymn in its original shape was
obviously an expanded form of the 148th Psalm.&quot; So even Gaster,
&quot;modelled evidently on Ps. cxlviii.&quot;<a id="fnt8" href="#fn8"><sup>[8]</sup></a>; while Wheatley<a id="fnt9" href="#fn9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> goes so far
as to say that it is &quot;an exact paraphrase&quot; of that psalm, &quot;and so like
it in words and sense that whoever despiseth this reproacheth that part
of the canonical writings.&quot;<a id="fnt10" href="#fn10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> But though the general idea for calling
upon nature to glorify God is the same, the author of <i>Benedicite</i> is
much more than a mere expander or imitator. Naturally many of the same
objects are mentioned; but while comparison with the LXX version of the
psalm shews some resemblance in word and thought, it shews much more
variation in style, phraseology, and treatment. That the writer, as a
Jew, was acquainted with this psalm can scarcely be doubted; that he
consciously imitated it there is little to shew. Moreover, the use of
this psalm at Lauds in the Ambrosian, the Eastern, and Quignon's
service-books, together with the <i>Benedicite</i>, would hardly have
occurred if the Church had regarded the latter <a class="pagenum" title="27" id="page27"></a>as a mere expansion of
the former, and not as a distinct production.</p>

<p>Whoever the author may have been, he was evidently strictly orthodox,
and quite in sympathy with his three heroes, in whose mouths he placed
this lively, agreeable, and most religious Song. He has added a much
appreciated treasure, at least among Christians, to the ecclesiastical
hooks; a most serviceable form of utterance for the Church's praiseful
voice. But the nature of the piece does not afford much scope for
display of the character or personality of the writer. He effaces
himself while extolling devotion to Jehovah, and, if he be Daniel, while
recording the faithfulness of the blessed friends of his youth. What
subject more likely to excite his enthusiastic sympathy? Honour to the
martyrs who endured, praise to the Lord who delivered, it was plainly a
pleasure to him to give.</p>
</div>

<div id="part2_3" class="section">
<h4>Date and Place.</h4>

<h5>Date.</h5>

<p>Almost everything, excepting its absence from the original, points to
the Song having been from the beginning a part of the LXX text of
Daniel. Its date therefore in this case would be the date of that text.
The way in which it is worked into the <a class="pagenum" title="28" id="page28"></a>canonical Daniel narrative
suggests that, if there be any variation as to date in the three
additions, this is seemingly the earliest.</p>

<p>That the LXX translator invented this enlargement out of his own genius
seems highly improbable; nor, were it not for its absence from the
original Daniel, few would have doubted that he obtained the whole of
his material from the same quarter. In such case our 'apocryphon' would
obviously ante-date the LXX text.</p>

<p>It is not unlikely that the Alexandrian translator worked up certain
traditions (J.M. Fuller, S.P.C.K. <i>Comm.</i>; see also Bevan, <i>Dan.</i> Camb.
1892, p. 45), or, if Gaster's discovery be what he thinks, written
narratives. What sources, however, were used in preparing its LXX Greek
form can only be conjectured, and that on very slender data.</p>

<p>Rothstein in Kautzsch (I. 176) deems it to have been imported into the
text of Daniel before the LXX translation, which he dates at latest in
the first quarter of the last century B.C.</p>

<p>How an interpolation of this kind came to be admitted into the original
of Daniel is a difficult matter to explain. Even on the supposition that
the <span xml:lang="he">&#1499;&#1514;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;</span> were less rigidly fixed than the Law or even the Prophets,
the insertion or omission of such a sec<a class="pagenum" title="29" id="page29"></a>tion as this seems a very bold
step. Ewald (<i>Hist. Israel</i>, v. 86, 87, Eng. Tr.) thinks these additions
to be fragments of an enlarged Daniel based on the older book, which was
composed one or two centuries earlier.<a id="fnt11" href="#fn11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> Some later writer must have
compared this new book, which was originally written in Greek, with the
translation of the older book of Daniel, and transferred whatever he
thought proper from the former into the latter. The work, thus compiled
afresh, has been preserved in Greek shape, while the intervening book,
whose former existence is proved by clearest traces, is now lost. It is
only in this way, Ewald thinks, that we can explain the origin and
preservation of the portions which are not contained in the Hebrew.</p>

<div id="fn11" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt11">[11]</a> He appears, on p. 303, to date Daniel between 160 and 170
B.C.</p>
</div>

<p>Prof. Kautzsch (I. 121) deems III. Maccabees, in vi. 6 of which book
there is a reference to v. 27 (50) of the Song, to date from some time
between the end of the second century B.C. and 70 A.D. at the latest.
Within these limits he fixes upon the commencement of the Christian era
as the most likely time. Dr. Streane, moreover (<i>Age of Macc.</i> p. 157),
thinks that while century I. B.C. is very possible, it cannot be of
earlier date, on account of the proof given by this verse of
acquaintance with the Song. This <a class="pagenum" title="30" id="page30"></a>reference, therefore, undoubted as it
is, does not greatly help us in solving the problem of date, except as
to its <i xml:lang="la">ad quem</i> limit.</p>

<p>Tob. xii. 6 and xiii. 10 (the latter especially in the Vulgate) are very
similar in phraseology to the refrain of the <i>Benedicite</i>; vv. 29, 30
(52) too, in both Greek versions, strongly suggest an acquaintance with
Tob. viii. 5, since <span xml:lang="el">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#949;</span> appears more likely to have been added to,
than omitted from, the later document of the two. This is on the
assumption that Tobit is, as Streane thinks (p. 148), pre-Maccabean, or
at any rate earlier than this Song. But as the words used are not very
distinctive, it is quite possible that they might have been
independently prepared. The mention of Ananias, Azarias, and Misael in
I. Macc. ii. 59 is not conclusive as to its writer's knowledge of the
Song, but the order of the names, which does not occur elsewhere, makes
a remembrance of v. 88 not improbable. I. Macc. is dated by Kautzsch
(I. 31) from 100 to 90 B.C.; Streane (p. 149) allows slightly wider
limits; and Westcott (Smith's <i>D.B.</i> II. 173) suggests 120 to 100. As to
another possible indication given by v. 66 (88), see 'Chronology,' p.
69.</p>

<p>Of that scepticism which followed the refinements of rabbinism there is
no trace, either here, or <a class="pagenum" title="31" id="page31"></a>in Susanna, or in Bel and the Dragon. The
tone of them all is that of an earlier time, free from any symptoms of
this later decline. But still the signs of date are not sufficiently
decided to justify us in fixing upon a narrow period with any degree of
certainty. Taking the piece as independent of the original Daniel, the
second century B.C. might perhaps be named as far from improbable. But a
closer date than this it is hardly safe to fix.</p>

<h5>Place.</h5>

<p>If we assume an <i>Aramaic original</i>, Babylonia most probably will be the
place for its production; Palestine somewhat less probably. But
indications of place in the piece itself are very faint. It is true,
however, that the order &quot;nights and days&quot; is &quot;in conformity with the
Shemitic custom of fixing the beginning of the day at the preceding
evening&quot; (McSwiney, <i>Psalms and Canticles</i>, 1901, p. 644).</p>

<p>Everyone must have noticed the frequency with which things watery and
things cold are mentioned in the Song. The number of times they occur
seems quite out of proportion with the scale on which it is conceived.
Water, showers, dew, cold, frost, snow,<a id="fnt12" href="#fn12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> sea, rivers, fountains, all
that move in the waters, are <a class="pagenum" title="32" id="page32"></a>apostrophised in succession. The
preponderance of these objects is very noticeable, even to a cursory
reader. Now both Babylon and Alexandria are alike situated in hot
countries; but of the two, a resident in the former would be more likely
to have had these things brought before his eyes than a resident in the
latter. Lower Egypt with its almost rainless climate, and its one river,
does not seem the most likely locality to suggest a constant reference
to such topics. Chald&aelig;a, on the other hand, is better watered and is
within the region of rain, and at any rate in its northern parts, of
frost and snow. Dura, according to Keith Johnston's map, is close to the
hills. But the position of &quot;the plain of Dura,&quot; where the martyrdom took
place, has not been certainly identified. J.M. Fuller's note on v. 42
(64), &quot;Rain and dew have that prominence which naturally belongs to them
in the parched East,&quot; is far from sufficing to explain the oft recurring
mention of these matters.</p>

<div id="fn12" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt12">[12]</a> This particularly is unsuggestive of Egypt.</p>
</div>

<p>Still less does Bishop Forbes' remark<a id="fnt13" href="#fn13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> that &quot;the element of water
seems specially to have received the benediction of the Lord,&quot; serve to
elucidate the cause of its preponderance here.</p>

</div>

<p>The slight anthropomorphism in v. 54, where 'sitting' is implied in &#920;,
expressed in &#927;&#8189;, is more con<a class="pagenum" title="33" id="page33"></a>formable to Babylonian than Alexandrian
ideas; but this may be a mere reminiscence of Psalms lxxx. 1, xcix. 1.
The mention of pitch or bitumen is inconclusive, inasmuch as it is found
in both Babylonia and Egypt; but the mention of &quot;heavens&quot; and &quot;stars of
heaven&quot; (vv. 59, 63), agrees very well with Chaldean origin. So far,
therefore, as these considerations go, they turn the scale, to a small
extent, in favour of Babylonia.</p>

<p>The only natural object which may be regarded as telling in the opposite
direction is <span xml:lang="el">&#954;&#942;&#964;&#951;</span> (v. 79), which might be thought to point to
knowledge of the Mediterranean Sea (<i>see</i> Child Chaplin, <i>Benedicite,</i>
1879, p. 324).</p>

<p>The birthplace of the LXX text is surely Alexandria. The character of
this, as of the other additions, indicates, according to Westcott
(<i>D.B.</i> ed. 2, I. 1714a) and Wordsworth (on Dan. iii. 23), the hand of
an Alexandrian writer.</p>

<p>It is well, however, to notice that this, with its companion pieces, has
as few indications of Greek philosophy and habits of thought as any part
of the Apocrypha; and in common with most Alexandrian writers it has
little or nothing of purely Egyptian character. Still, Dereser's idea
that &quot;Daniel may have written his book in Greek at Babylon with all <a class="pagenum" title="34" id="page34"></a>the
additions&quot; (quoted by Bissell, p. 444) seems most unlikely, and could
hardly have been advanced except under the necessity of supporting the
Roman view of the book.</p>

<p>Theodotion's version, so far as concerns the locality where it
originated, shares the obscurity which hangs over much of Theodotion's
personal life. Ephesus may be suggested, for Iren&aelig;us (III. xxiii.)
styles him <span xml:lang="el">&#8001; &#7961;&#966;&#941;&#963;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>; though Epiphanius calls him &#928;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#962; (<i>D.C.B.</i>
art. <i>Hexapla</i>, p. 22a). The latter author is, for the most part, the
less accurate of the two. In <i>De Mensuris, etc.</i>, XVII. he states that
&#920;'s version was issued in the second Commodus' reign, 180-192,
&quot;obviously too late.&quot;<a id="fnt14" href="#fn14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> The pre-Theodotionic version which &#920; is thought
to have used may of course have been an Alexandrian production; but at
present little is known of it.</p>

<p><a href="#fnt14">[14]</a> Swete, <i>Introd. to Greek O.T.</i>, p. 43.</p>
</div>

<p>That Theodotion had some earlier rendering, besides the LXX as his
basis, the quotations in Rev. ix. 20, etc., and St. Matt. xii. 18,
coinciding with his version,<a id="fnt15" href="#fn15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> render highly probable, inasmuch as he
wrote subsequently to any likely date for those books. Possibly he may
have used Aquila's version, or that of some unknown translator.
Professor Gwynn's idea (<i>D.C.B.</i> art. <i>Theodotion</i>, 977a) of &quot;two rival
Septua<a class="pagenum" title="35" id="page35"></a>gintal Daniels&quot;<a id="fnt16" href="#fn16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> seems to have more &quot;inherent improbability&quot;
than he is inclined to admit. But where this ground text, circulated
apparently in Palestine and Asia Minor, was made, who can say? But if we
take St. John as the author of Revelation, his connection with Ephesus,
and the probable publication of his work there, give some little support
to the theory of an Ephesian origin of Theodotion's translation.</p>

<p>It is strange that a version supposed to be made by one who was not an
orthodox Christian, if Christian at all, should have been preferred, as
far as concerns Daniel, by the Christian Church for ordinary use.<a id="fnt17" href="#fn17"><sup>[17]</sup></a>
Jerome (<i>Pr&aelig;f. in Dan.</i>) says, as if he felt that some explanation was
needed, &quot;et hoc cur acciderit nescio,&quot; though he proceeds to suggest
some possible reasons why the version of one &quot;qui utique post adventum
Christi incredulus fuit&quot; should have been so much honoured. The
religious work of a Jew, who lived before Christ, and that of one who
refused to acknowledge his advent after it had taken place, stand
obviously, for Christians, on a different footing.</p>

<h4>For Whom And With What Object Written.</h4>

<h5>For Whom.</h5>

<p>Undoubtedly for Jewish readers, who were already interested in the story
of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego; designed for those who had Daniel's
book in their hands, who felt the Three to be heroes rightly honoured.</p>

<p>Of course, if the words were really spoken by Azarias, they were for the
honour of God and the benefit of himself and his companions in the fire;
and the Song itself becomes a real thanksgiving, on the spur of the
moment, for the literal fulfilment of such promises as Isai. xliii. 2&mdash;a
form, for their own personal use, to express their immediate feelings.</p>

<p>Verse 24 (&#927;&#8189;) might suggest the idea that the prayer (and perhaps the
Song also) were uttered in the interval between the issue and the
execution of the king's order for burning alive; but the words <span xml:lang="el">&#7952;&#957; &#956;&#941;&#963;&#8179;
&#964;&#8183; &#960;&#965;&#961;&#943;</span> in v. 25 forbid this view. (As to a possible subsequent
insertion of the prayer, see 'Integr. and State of Text,' p. 42.)
Theodotion also precludes this idea by his insertion of <span xml:lang="el">&#7952;&#957; &#956;&#941;&#963;&#8179; &#964;&#8134;&#962;
&#966;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#8056;&#962;</span> in v. 24 itself, as well as <span xml:lang="el">&#7952;&#957; &#956;&#941;&#963;&#8179; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#965;&#961;&#8056;&#962;</span> in v. 25. The
slight change in the case of the last two words <a class="pagenum" title="37" id="page37"></a>lessens the likelihood
of their having been transferred from v. 25 of one version to v. 25
of the other. But it is quite possible that &#920; may have purposely omitted
the clause in v. 24 of &#927;&#8189;, beginning <span xml:lang="el">&#8005;&#964;&#949; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962;</span>, in order to shut out
the idea of these devotions having taken place in the interval suggested
above.</p>

<p>Dean Farrar even says that the Song is &quot;not very apposite&quot; (<i>Expositor's
Bible</i>, Daniel, Lond. 1895, p. 180), though other minds find it
remarkably so. In writing on v. 27 (50) he erroneously substitutes
<span xml:lang="el">&#957;&#972;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957;</span> for <span xml:lang="el">&#948;&#961;&#972;&#963;&#959;&#957;</span>. This is probably copied from Ball's note <i>in loc.</i> If
the latter part of v. 66 (88) was in the original Song, the reference
to their own position is of course apposite enough.</p>

<p>Even a writer of such a stamp as Albert Barnes (<i>Comm. on Dan.</i> iii. 23)
is obliged to confess that &quot;with some things that are improbable and
absurd, the Song contains many things that are beautiful and that would
be highly appropriate if a song had been uttered at all in the furnace.&quot;
But to a contrary effect J. Kennedy goes even further than Dean Farrar,
calling it &quot;an elaborate composition by some one whose imagination
failed to realise what was fitting and natural to men in the position of
the three Hebrews in the fiery furnace&quot; (<i>Dan. from a Christian
Standpoint,</i> 1898, p. 55).</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="38" id="page38"></a>The passage vv. 26 to 34 is provided in Littledale's <i>Priest's P.B.</i>
(1876, p. 95) as a suitable Scripture reading for those &quot;in fever.&quot;
Although there is a kind of appropriateness in the narrative of the fire
being driven off, many would regard this application of the extract as
highly fanciful, and not quite agreeable to the object with which the
piece was written.</p>
</div>

<h5>Object.</h5>

<p>Unless we assume the writer to be purely an imaginative novelist, the
preservation of serviceable traditions as profitable records of
religion, is clearly his principal aim. This addition cannot reasonably
be said in any way to distort or disagree with, though it adds to, the
sacred narrative. It is very well fitted into the main story; and the
non-appearance of Daniel is quite in accord with his absence from the
scene in chap. iii.</p>

<p>An edifying purpose is most conspicuous, and, if we assume that it is
really an interpolation of the original book, we may well suppose with
Bishop Gray, that &quot;some writer desirous of imitating and embellishing
the sacred text&quot; has left us this specimen of his work; that the
veneration of some Hellenistic Jew probably induced him to fabricate
this ornamental addition to the history (<i>op. cit.</i> pp. 610, 611).</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="39" id="page39"></a>One aim would be to satisfy the interest awakened by the wonderful
experiences of the three, which afforded a narrative ground-work for
this extension; falling in this respect, as Prof. Ryssel points out
(Kautzsch I. 167), into the same category as the Prayer of Manasses and
the additions to Esther. It may be said that resistance to idolatry,
securing divine deliverance, is, as in Bel and the Dragon, the &quot;motif&quot;
of the piece. But this is not accomplished without great peril and
anxiety to these martyrs in will, who kept before them an uncompromising
standard, worthy of their noble lineage (Dan. i. 3), as well as of their
true religion.</p>

<p>In some respects we are reminded of Jonah's prayer, which had a similar
object, viz., to secure a deliverance from hopeless danger, a
deliverance as marvellous as that of the Three. The words by which it is
introduced are similar (<span xml:lang="el">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#962;&#951;&#973;&#958;&#945;&#964;&#959; &#7992;&#969;&#957;&#8118;&#962;... &#7952;&#954; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#955;&#943;&#945;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8166;
&#954;&#942;&#964;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#949;&#7984;&#960;&#949;&#957;, Jon. ii. 2; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#963;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#8048;&#962; &#7944;&#950;&#945;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#962; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#962;&#951;&#973;&#958;&#945;&#964;&#959; &#954;&#945;&#8054;... &#7952;&#957;
&#956;&#941;&#962;&#8179; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#960;&#965;&#961;&#8056;&#962; &#949;&#7984;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span>, Dan. iii. 25, &#920;); and the spirit of turning to God
in dire straits is the same. But Jonah's prayer differs from Azarias' in
containing much mention of his immediate danger. Yet the absence of this
from Azarias' prayer hardly amounts to a probable indication <a class="pagenum" title="40" id="page40"></a>of
forgery; indeed the possibility of so long an utterance implies some
restraint of the consuming power of the furnace, such as is described in
v. 27 of the Chaldee.</p>

<p>A subsidiary purpose answered in the Song proper is that of joining
nature with ourselves, by addressing it in a series of invitations to
magnify Him who is its God and ours alike, thus interpreting the
feelings which nature maybe supposed to entertain. It is recognised that
the irrational as well as the rational have their rightful spheres of
action; and a wholesome sympathy is manifested with those portions of
nature&mdash;which we think are lower than ourselves. With this may be
compared Adam and Eve's morning hymn (in Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i>, Book
V., 1. 153 <i>sq.</i>), which is very similar in tone and in sequence of
objects apostrophized.</p>

<p>The Song so readily leads itself to use as a Canticle that the idea
inevitably arises of its having been composed with that purpose in view;
but proof that it was ever so used by the Jews seems entirely wanting.
The statements made in some P.B. manuals that it was so used appear to
have arisen from a misunderstanding of an ambiguous sentence of
Wheatley's (<i>see</i> 'Liturgical Use,' p. 83). Still, there may have been
an <i xml:lang="fr">arri&egrave;re pens&eacute;e</i> in the composer's mind of <a class="pagenum" title="41" id="page41"></a>providing models of
prayer and of praise for others, in crisis of trial or deliverance, to
offer unto God. It is pleasing to note in this respect, that the
thanksgiving is not stinted, but is even longer than the prayer. Nowhere
is the manifold wealth of God's revelation in nature more fully and
comprehensively set forth in the most exalted spirit of praise; so that,
if this were one of the composer's objects, it is most abundantly
answered.</p>
</div>

<div id="part2_5" class="section">
<h4>Integrity And State Of The Text.</h4>

<p>It has been suggested by Prof. Rothstein (in Kautzsch I. 174, 175) that
the prayer of Azarias, the intermediate narrative, and the Song itself,
were not all written at the same time. But this view is based purely on
internal probability, and derives little or no support from any of the
MSS. or versions, unless the introduction of titles in the Arabic after
v. 28 (51), and in some Greek copies to the prayer of Azarias, be
thought to give it countenance; yet these may have crept in from their
convenience for liturgical use, and so be accounted for merely on
practical grounds.</p>

<p>To base this separation, however, on a supposed disagreement between v.
15 (38) and vv. 31 (53), 62 (84), is certainly insufficient cause, as
Ball points <a class="pagenum" title="42" id="page42"></a>out (307b), for assigning Prayer and Song to different
writers (<i>see</i> 'Chronology,' p. 67). But the observation that the
narrative passage between the Prayer and the Song fits in well after the
canonical v. 23<a id="fnt18" href="#fn18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> seems a stronger basis for supposing that the prayer
is a later introduction than the Song. Rothstein points out (p. 181,
note d) that v. 1 (24) in &#920; has relation to the Song, but not to the
Prayer, and originally, as he imagines, took the place of the present v.
28 (91) of similar import. Corn. a Lap. notes of v. 1 (24) &quot;est
hysterologia.&quot; This view is also mentioned with favour in Charles'
article on Apocrypha in the 1902 vols. of <i>Encycl. Brit.</i> (<i>cf.</i> 'For
whom written,' p. 36).</p>

<div id="fn18" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt18">[18]</a> G. Jahn in his &quot;restoration&quot; of the Hebrew text of
Daniel from the
LXX, admits vv. 28 and 49-51 into his canonical text (Leipzig, 1904).</p>
</div>

<p>It is observable also that the statement of v. 26 (48) is not a mere
repetition of that in v. 22, but refers to the scorching of the
onlookers, while v. 22 speaks of those who executed the king's
order.<a id="fnt19" href="#fn19"><sup>[19]</sup></a></p>

<div id="fn19" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt19">[19]</a> As to the possibility of the fact, <i>cf. Yorkshire Post</i>,
April
12th, 1902, on Coronation bonfires: &quot;Spectators should keep clear of the
lee side. The flame of such bonfires has been known to stream in a flash
150ft. out.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>The repetition of the same invocation at the commencement of the Prayer
and the Song is noteworthy; <a class="pagenum" title="43" id="page43"></a>if the two are not contemporary, it has
probably been borrowed by the composer of the Prayer. But the difficulty
(often magnified) of reconciling the statements of v. 15 (38) with the
Jews' civil and ecclesiastical condition at the time of Daniel iii.
wears quite a different aspect if the Prayer is regarded as an
interpolation of later date by another hand. Altogether this theory of
the interpolation of the Prayer is surrounded with a considerable air of
probability.</p>

<p>Five extra verses are interspersed in the Syriac of the Song, calling
upon the hosts of the Lord, ye that fear the Lord, cold and heat (the
winter and summer of our <i>Benedicite</i>), the herbs of the field, and the
creeping things of the earth (Churton's translation). Of these &quot;frigus
and aestus&quot; is in the Vulgate, taken from &#920;. The source of the others is
unapparent, though creeping things would very naturally follow beasts
and cattle, as in Gen. vii. 14.</p>

<p>The present ending of the Song, after the usual refrain in the middle of
v. 66 (88) is of a laboured nature with a decidedly &quot;dragging&quot; style. It
certainly has the appearance of being an afterthought, added by some not
very skilful composer, who fancied the original termination to be too
abrupt, and thought he could attach an appropriate supplement. But of
<a class="pagenum" title="44" id="page44"></a>this theory no external evidence is at present forthcoming.</p>

<p>&#920; agrees with the &#927;&#8189; text much more closely in this than in the other
additions. Most verses are the same, word for word; and many others have
but the slightest variations. He makes a few small omissions, as in
(Greek) vv. 24, 40, 67, 68; but in general he follows &#927;&#8189; exactly. Even
vv. 67, 68, are contained in A, in both places, in Daniel and in the
Odes at the end; also they are in the Turin Psalter, though omitted in
the Veronese (Swete's LXX). As they are found, with a little difference
in the &#927;&#8189; text, they may have fallen out of B and Q accidentally. The
identical refrain at the end of each verse would naturally facilitate an
error of this kind.</p>

<p>The principal MSS. available for &#920;'s text are the same as those for the
canonical part of Daniel, A, B, and Q. &#915; fails us here, as in other
passages, except from vv. 37-52, in which its variations are
unimportant.</p>

<p>Taking B as the ground-work, A's changes are not generally of serious
moment, excepting in the case of the two inserted verses, 67 and 68, and
the transposition of vv. 73 and 74. Otherwise they chiefly consist of
small insertions or omissions which do not materially affect the sense
(vv. 36, 81); varying forms <a class="pagenum" title="45" id="page45"></a>from the same root such as <span xml:lang="el">&#8017;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#972;&#962;</span> for
<span xml:lang="el">&#945;&#7984;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#972;&#962;</span> (v. 54), <span xml:lang="el">&#949;&#8016;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#951;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962; for &#949;&#8016;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#951;&#964;&#972;&#962;</span> (v. 56). The correctors of B
in v. 38, though unsupported by the chief codices, certainly seem right
in substituting <span xml:lang="el">&#959;&#8016;&#948;&#949;</span> for <span xml:lang="el">&#959;&#8016;</span>. Q's variations not unfrequently agree with

<h4>Language And Style.</h4>

<h5>Language.</h5>

<p>The probability of a Semitic original lying in the background of this
piece, has always been considerable. Those who have maintained Greek as
the original language, have generally spoken a little less confidently
with regard to this than with regard to its two companion pieces. So
Bissell writes (p. 443), though a supporter of the Greek (p. 43),
&quot;undoubtedly more can be said in favour of such a theory&quot; [of a Semitic
original] &quot;than for a similar one in respect of the two remaining
additions.&quot; And since M. Gaster discovered in 1894 an Aramaic text, the
grounds for <a class="pagenum" title="46" id="page46"></a>deeming the Greek to be the original, though not set aside,
have been partially undermined. Sch&uuml;rer, however, in Hauck's <i>Encycl.</i>
(I. 639), appears to think that this is translated from &#920;, and not <i>vice
vers&acirc;,</i> as Gaster claims. In his third German ed. of <i>H.J.P.</i> (III. 333)
he agrees with Gaster in deeming <span xml:lang="he">&#1514;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1505;</span> to be &#920;, but considers the
Aramaic to be a rendering of &#920;'s Greek, taken into the tenth-century
Chronicle of Jerahmeel.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that the existence of two Greek versions increases
the probability, though it does not prove the existence, of an original
in another language. It does not seem likely that &#920; would have revised
the &#927;&#8189; of the additions in the same way as the canonical part, unless he
had a similar basis to go upon in both cases. If not, why, and on what
authority, did he alter the additions at all? And this consideration
applies to the other two, even more than to the one we are dealing with,
inasmuch as the version of Susanna and of Bel and the Dragon involved
more numerous changes. Iren&aelig;us' statement that Theodotion &quot;<span xml:lang="el">&#7969;&#961;&#956;&#942;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#963;&#949;&#957;</span>,&quot;
taken strictly, would of course always imply an original to translate;
but Iren&aelig;us may only have been thinking of the particular passage from
Isaiah which he refers to (III. xxiii.).</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="47" id="page47"></a>Many phrases may be instanced which point to a Semitic original, or at
least fit in well with the theory of its existence. Towards
counterbalancing this there is a much smaller number which may be
thought to tell in the opposite direction. But in the main, as Comely
truly writes (<i>op. cit.</i> p. 420), &quot;<span xml:lang="la">accedit hebraismorum frequentia quum
in Alexandrini tum in Theodotionis versione.</span>&quot;<a id="fnt20" href="#fn20"><sup>[20]</sup></a></p>

<div id="fn20" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt20">[20]</a> Dr. Julian (<i>Diet. Hymnol.</i> p. 134) has the following
strange
sentence as to <i>Benedicite</i>, &quot; It is not in the Hebrew version (<i>sic</i>)
of the Scriptures, and on this ground, among others, it is omitted from
A.V.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>It is to be observed, however, that the names of the Three are Grecized
from their original Hebrew nomenclature,<a id="fnt21" href="#fn21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> although their Babylonian
names are employed in Dan. iii., and adopted by &#927;&#8189; and &#920; in the
canonical portions, both before and after the apocryphal episode. An
apparent exception occurs in v. 23 of &#927;&#8189;, where clauses of that verse
and of v. 22 have been transposed and slightly altered. Here Azarias
occurs in the same form as in the apocryphal portion. But this isolated
use of the Hebrew form of his name has probably been brought <a class="pagenum" title="48" id="page48"></a>about by
the insertion of our piece into the chapter, the same form and phrase,
<span xml:lang="el">&#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#7944;&#950;&#945;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#957;</span>, being found in v. 49 of both Greek texts. A like
phrase occurs in Ezek. xxxviii. 6, and in Acts xiii. 13. The order of
names, too, differs in this Addition from their order elsewhere, the two
last changing places, thus bringing Azarias (Abed-nego) into the middle.
It is remarkable that he is twice, vv. 2 (25) and 8 (49), placed as if
he were the leading member of the trio, in the former verse as uttering
the prayer, in the latter as heading the party in the furnace; and so
also, as pointed out above, in v. 23 of &#927;&#8189;. This last fact, however, is
counterbalanced in the same version by all three being named in v. 24 as
praying, Azarias not there figuring as the sole speaker. These small
indications certainly point to some ancient distinction between the
uncanonical insertion, as we have it, and the body of the book.</p>

<div id="fn21" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt21">[21]</a> G. Jahn <i>in loc.</i> thinks this fact an indication of a later
hand,
as shewing that they severed themselves in the furnace from contact with
heathenism, and were giving themselves to intercourse with Jahwe alone.
But surely an interpolator must have been aware that this was their
attitude from the outset.</p>
</div>

<p>E. Philippe (in Vigouroux' <i>D.B.</i> II. p. 1266) argues for Hebrew and
not Greek originals, because of the existence of two Greek versions,
neither of which, he says, appears to be a revision of the other,
containing hebraisms suggestive of a Hebrew original. But as regards the
Song of the Three, this statement, that neither version is a revision of
the other, must be regarded as more than doubtful. He also says <a class="pagenum" title="49" id="page49"></a>that
the Chisian and Syro-Hexaplar MSS. contain critical signs of Origen,
revealing a Hebrew text, and in 87 (Chisianus) at xiii. 1-5, &#913;&#8189;, &#931;&#8189;, &#920;&#8189;
indicate Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion, all translators from the
Hebrew. This last point, however, may not stand as to the Song of the
Three (<i>see</i> note in Kautzsch, p. 176) so far as Aquila is concerned.
For Origen, in his letter to Africanus, seems to imply that Aquila's
rendering did not contain the Song: <span xml:lang="el">&#927;&#8021;&#964;&#969; &#947;&#8048;&#961; &#7944;&#954;&#973;&#955;&#945;&#962; &#948;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#949;&#973;&#969;&#957; &#964;&#8135; &#7961;&#946;&#961;&#945;&#953;&#954;&#8135;
&#955;&#949;&#958;&#949;&#953; &#7952;&#954;&#948;&#941;&#948;&#969;&#954;&#949;&#957;</span>&mdash;&sect; 2.</p>

<p>Jerome's words in the Vulgate, after v. 23, &quot;<span xml:lang="la">qu&aelig; sequuntur in Hebraeis
voluminibus non reperi</span>,&quot; are very guarded, not absolutely denying the
existence of a Hebrew text, but merely asserting that he has not met
with it. Cod. Amiatinus, however, has 'non repperiuntur,' an expression
which asserts more comprehensively the absence of this passage in his
time.</p>

<p>The following are some specific indications of language which appear to
be of sufficient interest to be noted separately:</p>

<p>v. 27 &#927;&#8189;, &#920;. <span xml:lang="el">&#916;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#949;&#7990; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#960;&#8118;&#963;&#953;&#957;</span> = <span xml:lang="he">&#1510;&#1463;&#1512;&#1460;&#1468;&#1497;&#1511; &#1510;&#1463;&#1500;</span> rendered by <span xml:lang="el">&#7952;&#960;&#8054;</span> in Dan.
ix. 14 (in both versions) and in Neh. ix. 33. <span xml:lang="el">&#916;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#7952;&#960;&#8054;</span> also occurs in
Bar. ii. 9, in that part of Baruch which is almost certainly a
<a class="pagenum" title="50" id="page50"></a>translation from the Hebrew. Ball (<i>Speaker's Comm.</i>) gives a similar
phrase from the <i>Iliad</i>, and Bissell a still more apposite one from
<i>Il.</i> IV. 28, to shew that it is not unknown in pure Greek. Gaster's
Aramaic has simply <span xml:lang="he">&#1500;</span> not <span xml:lang="he">&#1510;&#1500;</span>.</p>

<p>v. 30 &#927;&#8189;, &#920;. <span xml:lang="el">&#8025;&#960;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#969;</span> governs the genitive correctly, but <span xml:lang="el">&#963;&#965;&#957;&#964;&#951;&#961;&#941;&#969;</span>,
coupled with it, is made to govern the same noun. Exigencies of
translation might easily cause this awkwardness, but hardly original
Greek composition.</p>

<p>v. 31 &#927;&#8189;. <span xml:lang="el">&#922;&#945;&#8054; &#957;&#8166;&#957;</span> = <span xml:lang="he">&#1493;&#1456;&#1510;&#1463;&#1514;&#1468;&#1464;&#1492;</span> So translated in II. Chron. vi. 16, 17 at
the beginning of the verse, as here; it occurs again in vv. 33 and 41 in
both versions, as also in ix. 15, 17. It is not a very natural beginning
of a Greek sentence.</p>

<p>v. 32 &#927;&#8189;, &#920;. Why <span xml:lang="el">&#7937;&#960;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#964;&#8182;&#957;</span>, a title which does not seem very applicable
to the Babylonians? It may be merely a rendering of <span xml:lang="he">&#1496;&#1512;&#1498;</span> as in Ezra iv.
12, 15. The Vulgate here has 'pr&aelig;varicator.' In Gaster's Aramaic the
verse is different. But <i>cf.</i> use of <span xml:lang="el">&#7936;&#960;&#951;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#964;&#961;&#953;&#969;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span> in Eph. ii. 12 of
those who had never belonged to Israel.</p>

<p>v. 33 &#927;&#8189;, &#920;. <span xml:lang="el">&#927;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#957; &#7969;&#956;&#8150;&#957; &#7936;&#957;&#959;&#8150;&#958;&#945;&#953;</span> looks very like a translation of
<span xml:lang="he">&#1488;&#1461;&#1497;&#1503; &#1500;&#1464;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;</span>, an idiom used in II. Chron. xxxv. 3, 15 in the sense of
'cannot,' followed by a verb in the infinitive. <i>Cf.</i> Heb. ix. 5.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="51" id="page51"></a>v. 34 &#927;&#8189;, &#920;. <span xml:lang="el">&#917;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#941;&#955;&#957;&#962;</span> = <span xml:lang="he">&#1500;&#1456;&#1499;&#1464;&#1500;&#1464;&#1492;</span> or <span xml:lang="he">&#1500;&#1464;&#1504;&#1462;&#1510;&#1463;&#1495;</span> as in II.

the rendering of such a phrase as that in I. Kings xv. 19,

<p>v. 36 &#927;&#8189;, &#920;. <span xml:lang="el">&#7948;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#945; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#959;&#8016;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#8166;</span>, as in viii. 10, xii. 3, both &#927;&#8189;.</p>

<p>v. 37 &#927;&#8189;, &#920;. <span xml:lang="el">&#932;&#945;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#8054; &#7952;&#957;</span>. Did the translators read <span xml:lang="he">&#1489;&#1499;&#1500;</span> for <span xml:lang="he">&#1502;&#1499;&#1500;</span>?</p>

suggests &quot;<span xml:lang="he">&#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;</span> ut Job i. I, 8, ii. 3,&quot; where <span xml:lang="el">&#952;&#949;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#946;&#942;&#962;</span> is the word.</p>

<p>The writer deems the evidence of language to point on the whole to a
Semitic rather than to a Greek base. The difficulty of balancing the
indications however of the original language is shewn by the names of
important authorities which may be ranged on either side, Ball,
Rothstein, and Swete regarding the Semitic as probable; Westcott,
Sch&uuml;rer, and Fritzsche holding a similar opinion as to the Greek.</p>

<p>When a Semitic original is pronounced for, the <a class="pagenum" title="54" id="page54"></a>further question arises,
was it Hebrew or Aramaic? The grounds unfortunately appear too
indecisive to warrant a distinct choice between these alternatives.</p>


<h5>Style.</h5>

<p>This is the only one of the three Additions which takes a devotional and
poetical form. The Song has perhaps exceeded the others in the great
estimation accorded to it. The frequent liturgical use made of it is
both a sign and a cause of this.</p>

<p>The style of the Greek is Hellenistic, and is not out of character with
the versions of which it is a part; nor in particular with the Book of
Daniel with which it is incorporated. It is spirited, interesting, and
agreeable, mainly Hebraic in the character of its thought and cast of
its language.</p>

<p>The Prayer may possibly be accused of the needless repetition of similar
sentiments; especially in vv. 4, 5, and 8 as to God's truth and justice;
and in vv. 6 and 7 as to Israel's disobedience, which are somewhat
over-insisted upon. But perhaps this may be attributed to earnest
pleading. It is instructive to compare and contrast Daniel's Prayer,
chap. ix., remembering that a different person would naturally have a
different style; a consideration which may also help to account for the
change we are conscious <a class="pagenum" title="55" id="page55"></a>of when we pass from the prayer of Azarias to
the Song which purports to he the composition of the Three.</p>

<p>The principle on which <span xml:lang="el">&#960;&#8118;&#962;</span> is inserted in some verses and omitted in
others does not seem clear. Rhythmical considerations do not
sufficiently account for it. Something other than style seems to have
influenced its use; but what that something may have been it is
difficult to discern. Nor does the principle seem clearer in the Aramaic
than in the Greek.</p>

<p>The poem has a simple yet majestic structure, with a refrain apt to
linger in the ear, either in Greek or English, <span xml:lang="el">&#917;&#8016;&#955;&#959;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#964;&#949;, &#8017;&#956;&#957;&#949;&#8150;&#964;&#949;, &#954;&#945;&#8054;
&#8017;&#960;&#961;&#965;&#968;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#949; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#945;&#7984;&#8182;&#957;&#945;&#962;</span>, &quot;Bless ye the Lord, praise Him, and
magnify Him for ever.&quot; In Gaster's Aramaic the refrain is slightly
varied, <span xml:lang="he">&#1500;&#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1488;</span> being used where God is addressed, <span xml:lang="he">&#1489;&#1510;&#1500;&#1502;&#1488;</span> where His
creatures are exhorted. Dr. Gaster understands the former to mean &quot;for
ever,&quot; but the latter &quot;in the world.&quot;<a id="fnt22" href="#fn22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> This distinction, if a just
one, is entirely obliterated in the versions. In the Vulgate however the
refrain sounds less agreeably, for &quot;superexaltate &quot; is a cumbrous word
for frequent repetition. It is one of those exaggerated compounds of
which the trans<a class="pagenum" title="56" id="page56"></a>lator of Daniel seems to have been too fond, such as
&quot;<span xml:lang="la">superlaudabilis</span>,&quot; &quot;<span xml:lang="la">supergloriosus</span>&quot; (v. 52), &quot;<span xml:lang="la">deambulo</span>&quot; and
&quot;<span xml:lang="la">disco&ouml;perio</span>&quot; (Sus. vv. 8, 32). This inconvenience was evidently felt in
liturgical use, as in the Roman Breviary and Missal the repetition of
&quot;<span xml:lang="la">superexaltate</span>&quot; is avoided. Psalm cxxxvi. affords a biblical instance of
a refrain similarly repeated at the end of each verse; and Deut. xxvii.
15-26 may be regarded as containing a liturgical repetition of another
species.</p>

<div id="fn22" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt22">[22]</a> <i>Proc. Sac. Bibl. Arch&aelig;ol.</i> 1895, p. 80.</p>
</div>

<p>The use of a symbolic multiple of 7 in v. 24 (47) accords well with a
similar practice in Daniel iii. 19, ix. 24, and x. 2,13. The number 3
itself (v. 28) may also be symbolic; but this is merely continued from
the canonical part of the story, being quite of a piece with it. No
other numbers occur.</p>

<p>There is a remarkable resemblance between the natural objects mentioned
in Ecclus. xliii. and in the Song. Especially v. 22<a id="fnt23" href="#fn23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> of the former is
like v. 27 (50) of the latter in its leading idea. The furnace, <span xml:lang="el">&#954;&#940;&#956;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>,
is also named in v. 4 of the Ecclus. passage; and the aim of glorifying
God is most prominent in both. But the resemblance in style to Psalm
cxlviii. is not so great as has sometimes been imagined. (See what is
said on this point under <a class="pagenum" title="57" id="page57"></a>'Authorship,' p. 26.) On the whole, the style
of the work, whether supplicatory, narrative, or poetic, is well suited
to the purpose for which it is designed; and although the influence of
previous writers is evident, the manner of the author is not that of a
mere imitator of their compositions. He has a form of his own in which
to present his subject.</p>

<div id="fn23" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt23">[23]</a> In the Hebrew of this verse the parallel is less striking.</p>

<div id="part2_7" class="section">
<h4>Religious And Social State.</h4>

<h5>Religious.</h5>

<p>So far as the Jewish actors in the scene are concerned, they exhibit a
true religious spirit from the O.T. standpoint, with an unshakeable
firmness of conviction that Jehovah alone should be worshipped.</p>

<p>The episode shews (in common with the canonical part) that the Captivity
had already produced a stubborn opposition to idolatrous temptations
among the Jews. The tendency to follow after other gods, and to depart
from Jehovah in this way, had been outrooted from the habits of these
exiles; and their example now would be for all time an incentive to
others to resist, at any cost, the pressing inducements to become
idolaters.</p>

<p>It is difficult to find anything really inconsistent with the religious
position, so far as we know it, <a class="pagenum" title="58" id="page58"></a>of Israel in Babylon. Bissell, however,
writes strongly to the contrary, in company as he avers, with almost all
non-Romish scholars. This opinion is based on little more than the
supposed inappropriateness of the Prayer and Song to the occasion, and
on the discrepancy of v. 15 (38) with the circumstances of the time, and
with other parts of the composition (p. 445 and on v. 15). This
&quot;discrepancy&quot; is dealt with under 'Chronology.' Bissell also quotes with
approval the exaggerated comparison of Eichhorn, who deems the three
&quot;like dervishes gifted in penitential exclamations, which they interrupt
by abuse of Nebuchadnezzar.&quot; A consistent religious ground is maintained
throughout by the three; there is for them no &quot;doing at Rome as Rome
does&quot; in vital matters of religion. And their condition is evidently
compassionated by God, their faithfulness approved, amid the
persecutions of a foreign land.</p>

<p>Considerable talent and art in devotional composition are manifested in
confession, petition, and praise&mdash;talent and art of which the Christian
Church has widely availed herself from a very early period. The tone of
Azarias' prayer is not discordant with Daniel's description of his own
prayer in ix. 20, nor with the prayer itself immediately preceding that
verse, either in sentiment or phraseology. They <a class="pagenum" title="59" id="page59"></a>may well have come from
the same editor, whether the prime author of the whole book or not.
Verse 16 (39) apparently contains phrases culled from Pss. xxxiv. 18,
li. 17. M. Parker on Deut. xxviii. 56 (<i>Bibliotheca Biblica</i>, Oxf. 1735)
thinks that the declaration of the three in v. 9 (32) corresponds with
Deut. xxviii. 49, 50, being in fact a public acknowledgment that
national impiety had brought upon them the distress in which they were
at present involved. If so, it shews knowledge of the law on their part.
But the connection is one solely of idea, and not of phraseology. There
is a strong connection in phraseology, however, between v. 27 and Deut.
xxxii. 4 in LXX. In any case the religious tone of the whole production
is not inconsistent with what we might have expected.</p>

<h5>Social.</h5>

<p>The nature of this piece does not afford much scope for the display of
the social condition of Babylon and its inhabitants. It is to be
expected therefore that it will shew us far less of these matters than
either Susanna or Bel and the Dragon. But so far as it gives any
indications, it is in accord with the canonical Daniel, and with what we
know from other sources of the customs of the country. Evi<a class="pagenum" title="60" id="page60"></a>dently Israel
was in a state of subjection to the Babylonian king, who ordered
idolatry to be practised by captives and natives alike. It is shewn by
v. 9 (32) <i>sqq.</i> that the former smarted under his tyranny, and appealed
to God for redress, like their forefathers in Egyptian bondage.</p>

<p>The punishment of burning, on which the whole story turns, is quite
Babylonian. Jer. xxix. 22 is another instance, so that there is no lack
of <i xml:lang="fr">vraisemblance</i> in its introduction here. (<i>See</i> Hastings' <i>D.B.</i>
art. <i>Crimes and Punishments</i>, I. 523, for other instances). It has been
thought (Smith's <i>D.B.</i> ed. 2 art. <i>Furnace</i>, I. 1092b) that this
furnace in Daniel is alluded to by our Lord in St. Matt. xiii. 42, 50;
but how opposite on this occasion are the consequences of being cast
into it! Here prayer and praise from the righteous, there weeping and
gnashing from the wicked. The allusion must be considered a very
doubtful one.</p>

<p>The subservience of the king's servants<a id="fnt24" href="#fn24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> in performing their cruel
work, and the absence of a protesting voice or of a helping hand from
any quarter, is very characteristic of the results of Eastern despotism.
All, except the three martyrs, were afraid of <a class="pagenum" title="61" id="page61"></a>Nebuchadnezzar, whose
murderous rage under contradiction is of a piece in both the Chaldee and
the Greek portions of the chapter. No one else on this occasion dared to
disobey his decree, and there is no sign of anyone venturing so much as
to intercede for the Jewish victims.</p>

<div id="fn24" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt24">[24]</a> &#8017;&#960;&#951;&#961;&#941;&#964;&#945;&#953;, v. 23 (46),
attendants probably holding some official
position superior to that of slaves. <i>Cf.</i> St. John xviii. 18.</p>
</div>

<p>In such small glimpses as are given, in this extension of chap. iii., of
the social state of Babylonia there is nothing clearly indicating that
the interpolation (if such it be) is of an unhistoric or untrustworthy
character, nothing wholly irreconcilable with the rest of the book.
Indeed the author (W.T. Bullock) of the note on Daniel iii. 23 in the
S.P.C.K. <i>Commentary</i> goes so far as to write of &quot;that noble canticle
<i>Benedicite</i>,&quot; as an &quot;historical document.&quot; This expression may require
qualification, but it is not beyond the bounds of possible fact.</p>
</div>

<div id="part2_8" class="section">
<h4>Theology.</h4>

<p>The theology appears to be of a perfectly orthodox character, quite what
might have been expected from the three children; nor is it inconsistent
with that contained in the rest of the book of Daniel. The exile had not
now contaminated the Jewish religion, but had rather purged it of its
corruptions, and eradicated in particular the fatal tendency to <a class="pagenum" title="62" id="page62"></a>&quot;serve
other gods.&quot; Such sins are thoroughly confessed by Azarias in a style
not without resemblance to Daniel's confession. (<i>Cf.</i> v. 6 (29) with
ix. 5 in both versions; also Esther xiv. 6, 7.)</p>

<p>The God of their fathers is He alone to whom prayers and praises are to
be addressed. He is regarded as the Lord of all creation, both as a
whole and in its specific parts. He is looked up to to make good the old
promises (13), being full of mercy (19), as well as of power and glory
(20, 22, 68). He is a king (33), just (4), and gracious (67), with an
ear open to the addresses of his people. The righteousness of even His
heavy judgements is acknowledged in the prayer; and the hymn throughout
shews that the gratitude of man is plainly deemed acceptable to Him.</p>

<p>As to the question of praise being called for from inanimate things or
irrational beings, we must remember that though unfitted, so far as we
understand them, for conscious praise, their creation, maintenance, and
usefulness give evidence of God's greatness and goodness. As Cornelius &agrave;
Lapide notes on v. 35 (57) &quot;<span xml:lang="la">Inanimes creatur&aelig; benedicunt Deum creatorem
suum, non ore sed opere, ait S. Hieronymus</span>,&quot; giving, however, no
reference to the passage in Jerome. Ps. civ. 4 and Heb. i. 7 afford
<a class="pagenum" title="63" id="page63"></a>some helpful clues to the operations of Nature in this connection. Man
is treated by our author as the interpreter of Nature, with a right, as
made in the image of God, to call upon it to glorify its Maker. He
offers vocal praise on its hehalf as well as on his own; though things
without life praise God silently, by fulfilling the parts for which He
made them. A somewhat similar idea of the elevating influence exerted by
natural beings may be discerned in the second of the <i>New sayings of
Jesus</i> as restored by Messrs. Grenfell and Hunt (Lond. 1904, p. 15). And
Addison fitly writes (<i>Spect.</i> No. 393), &quot;The cheerfulness of heart
which springs up in us from the survey of Nature's works, is an
admirable preparation for gratitude &quot;(<i>cf.</i> 'Early Christian Literature
and Art,' <i>s.v.</i> 'Hippolytus').</p>

<p>Azarias desires that the rescue of the party may redound to the
knowledge among all men of the sole deity of Jehovah (22)&mdash;a petition
for the conversion of the Gentiles. The phrase in the last verse of the
Song, <span xml:lang="el">&#952;&#949;&#8056;&#962; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#952;&#949;&#8182;&#957;</span>, might be taken as an admission of the existence of
other gods over whom Jehovah was supreme. But clearly this is not so
intended, as may be proved from the use of the phrase in Deut. x. 17,
Pss. xlix. I (LXX), cxxxvi. 2. Yet it is not unlikely that
Nebuchadnezzar used the phrase in this <a class="pagenum" title="64" id="page64"></a>acceptation in ii. 47. The other
occasion, however, on which it is used in Daniel (xi. 36), allows it to
be taken only in an orthodox sense; nor is any other likely in the mouth
of Azarias, who resisted to the utmost the command to sin by idolatry.
It is observable that Azarias omits the clause &quot;in thy seed shall all
nations of the earth be blessed&quot; (Gen. xxii. 18, xxvi. 4) from his
quotation of the patriarchal promise. This might arise from dislike to
the nations, who had conquered Israel; but on the other hand, the gist
of it is contained in his concluding petition in v. 22.</p>

<p>The objection that Ananias, Azarias, and Misael are invoked as saints
(which probably caused the omission in 1789 of v. 66 (88) from the
American P.B.) is sufficiently answered by pointing out that the Song is
praise, not prayer; and that these three do not stand on a different
footing in this respect from the other objects apostrophized. Moreover,
a highly poetical composition of this kind is not to be too literally
interpreted. As Liddon remarks in his <i>Elements of Religion</i> (Lond.
1892, p. 182), &quot;The apostrophes of the Psalms and Benedicite are really
acts of praise to God, of which his creatures furnish the occasion;&quot; and
Addison again (<i>Spect.</i> No. 327), &quot;Invocations of this nature fill the
mind with glorious ideas of God's <a class="pagenum" title="65" id="page65"></a>works.&quot; v. 43 (65) is oddly applied
by Archdeacon Frank, <i>Serm.</i> XLII. to Pentecost (Oxf. 1849, II. 254).</p>

<p>Belief is plainly shewn in an angelic ministry, sent down to help God's
suffering servants, and endued with miraculous powers. The angel comes,
too, after their humble confession and prayer for rescue (vv. 43-45),
and before their song of praise. The very propriety however of this
arrangement, from a theological point of view, induces Rothstein to deem
the prayer a subsequent introduction, in order to supply the want of
request for deliverance before praise for its accomplishment; and he
thinks that the opening in the narrative for the insertion of the prayer
(between vv. 23 and 46) was not, in the &#927;&#8189;, very deftly effected
(Kautzsch, I. 175, 181).</p>

<p>The natural and the supernatural, without any incongruity, are blended
as being all under one control, all subserving the same great ends, as
in the Hebrew Bible. But there is no increase of the miraculous element
beyond that in chapter iii., in which this piece is inserted; and at a
later age increase would have been highly probable. What essential
difference is there to be found between the miracles of the Chaldee and
of the Greek Daniel? Surely none.</p>

<p>A typical resemblance was discerned by St. <a class="pagenum" title="66" id="page66"></a>Antony of Padua (<i>Moral
Concordances</i>, ed. Neale, p. 123), between v. 26 (44) and the
Annunciation, but this will be regarded by many minds as a very fanciful
theological discovery, and one surely not in the purview of the composer
of the passage.</p>
</div>

<div id="part2_9" class="section">
<h4>Chronology.</h4>

<p>There is but little in the way of chronological indication in this
addition; considerably less than in the other two, and what there is, is
indirectly brought in.</p>

<p>A time after the Captivity is evidently pointed to in vv. 26, 32, 37,
38. Jerusalem was lying under a heavy visitation, the people delivered
over to the enemy, almost denationalized, and deprived of the
sacrificial worship to which they had been accustomed. Yet this position
of affairs is spoken of as if it were not one of very long standing.
(<i>Cf.</i> the use of <span xml:lang="el">&#957;&#8166;&#957;</span> in vv. 31, 33, 42, though in the last of these
instances its use may not perhaps be temporal.)</p>

<p>It has been objected, quite unnecessarily, that v. 38 is inconsistent
with v. 53, the one implying the destruction of the temple, the other
recognizing its existence; v. 84, too, may be taken as supposing priests
to be still capable of performing their offices. It is even possible
that the corrections of Cod. A in <a class="pagenum" title="67" id="page67"></a>v. 38 may have had behind them some
idea of softening a discrepancy. This supposed lack of consistency has
been taken as an indication of double authorship of the Prayer and the
Song; and of course, if the Prayer were a later interpolation than the
Song, even the appearance of contemporary inconsistency is avoided. But
if we were to decline this hypothesis, and take Prayer and Song as from
the same pen, there is still no real difficulty; for v. 38 is thinking
of the earthly temple, v. 53 of the heavenly. Grotius (<i>Critici Sacri</i>),
apparently accepting the statements of v. 38 as correct, writes: &quot;Harum
rerum penuria animos venture Evangelio pr&aelig;parabit.&quot;</p>

<p>Another chronological difficulty, that of &quot;no prophet,&quot;<a id="fnt25" href="#fn25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> in the same
verse (38) has even been offered as a 'proof' of non-canonicity
(Cloquet, <i>Articles</i>, p. 113). So T.H. Horne in Vol. IV. of his
<i>Introduction</i>, quoted by A. Barnes on Daniel (I. 81), says that &quot;v. 15
(38) contains a direct falsehood&quot;; and in Vol. II. 937 of his
<i>Introduction</i> (ed. 1852), he asserts that the author &quot;slipped in the
part he assumed.&quot; More just is his observation that &quot;Theodotion does not
appear to have marked the discrepancy.&quot; Ball, too, joins in the
condemnation, by <a class="pagenum" title="68" id="page68"></a>expressing an opinion that the writer had &quot;lost his
cue&quot; (<i>Introd. to Song</i>, p. 308); and Reuss, &quot;Hier verr&auml;t sich der
Verfasser&quot; (<i>O.T.</i>, Brunswick, 1894, VII. 166). It has been suggested
(J.H. Blunt <i>in loc.</i>) that Ezekiel, who was both priest and prophet,
had just finished his utterances, while Daniel, if he had commenced his,
would, out of modesty, not reckon himself. The same commentator also
attempts, still less successfully, to overcome the difficulty of &quot;no
prince.&quot; Probably, however, this merely means that no monarch was
actually reigning, and that Jewish rulers were themselves ruled and
their authority superseded, not that no member of the royal house or of
the ruling classes was in existence. And this seems to fit in better
with an early period of the Captivity than with a later age, when Simon
Maccabeus is said to have had the title <span xml:lang="he">&#1504;&#1464;&#1513;&#1460;&#1465;&#1497;&#1488;</span> on his coins: and
Mattathias is called <span xml:lang="el">&#7940;&#961;&#967;&#969;&#957;</span> in I Macc. ii. 17. Gesenius says in his
<i>Thesaurus</i> under <span xml:lang="he">&#1504;&#1513;&#1497;&#1488;</span> on the authority of F.P. Bayer (<i xml:lang="la">de numis
hebraeosamaritanis</i>, p. 171, append, p. xv.), that Simon's coins had the
inscription <span xml:lang="he">&#1513;&#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1503; &#1504;&#1513;&#1497;&#1488; &#1497;&#1513;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;</span><a id="fnt26" href="#fn26"><sup>[26]</sup></a>; but it is now doubted whether the
coins formerly attributed to Simon are really of his time. (<i>Cf.</i> Bp.
<a class="pagenum" title="69" id="page69"></a>Wordsworth of Lincoln on I Macc. xv. 6.) Z&ouml;ckler's idea (<i>Comm. in
loc.</i>) that <span xml:lang="el">&#7969;&#947;&#959;&#973;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span> must be understood here as equivalent to &quot;priest&quot;
is unsupported and needless. <span xml:lang="he">&#1499;&#1468;&#1476;&#1492;&#1461;&#1503;</span> is never so translated by LXX.</p>

</div>

<p>Cornelius &agrave; Lap. (Paris, 1874), deals with the difficulty of &quot;no
prophet&quot; in a different way. He writes, &quot;<span xml:lang="la">Quia Dan. potius somniorum
regiorum erat interpres, quam propheta populi; Ezech. autem propheta
aberat agebatque in Chobar aliisque Chaldaeae locis, eratque is unus et
captivus. Itaque 'non est,' <i>i.e.</i> vix nullus erat.</span>&quot; Of &quot;<span xml:lang="la">princeps et
dux</span>&quot; he says nothing; but Peronne adds a note to say that Daniel was
thinking of Judaea only. It is not unlikely that Hos. iii. 4 was in the
mind of the writer of the Song, as being fulfilled in his days.</p>

<p>If, however, we assume a date for the whole piece considerably later
than that of the canonical book, it is quite conceivable that the author
may have made a backward transference of the circumstances of his own
time to that of the earlier exile. For this is a species of error all
traces of which even expert forgers find it difficult to remove.</p>

<p>It is generally assumed, and probably rightly, that v. 88 is intended as
a contemporary utterance of the Three calling upon themselves;
nevertheless it is quite intelligible as the expression of a later
writer <a class="pagenum" title="70" id="page70"></a>summoning them, with the rest of creation, to praise their
Maker. And, assuming this verse to be contemporary with the rest, this
latter idea would of course mark the hymn as not really issuing from the
mouths of the Three.</p>

<p>Everything said and done in this piece takes place within one day, the
day on which Nebuchadnezzar's subjects were ordered to worship the
golden image. There is therefore much less scope than in Bel and the
Dragon, or even Susanna, for those who seek to discover chronological
difficulties, because devotional compositions afford fewer openings than
narrative matter for the raising of such questions.</p>

<div id="part2_10" class="section">
<h4>Canonicity.</h4>

<p>Like Susanna, and Bel and the Dragon, the Song of the Three Children
formed, so far as we know, part of the original LXX text of Daniel,
having a connection with it closer even than theirs. For while they take
their places at the beginning or the end, this one is incorporated into
the narrative of chapter iii. as one connected whole. Prof. Robertson
Smith does indeed write (<i>O.T. in Jewish Church</i>, 1895, p. 154), &quot;these
are perhaps later additions to the Greek version&quot;; but this is only
conjecture, and as such he puts it forward.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="71" id="page71"></a>Until the correspondence of Origen with Africanus, the canonicity of
these pieces does not seem to have been called in question by Christians
who used Greek or Latin Bibles; nor do Greek-speaking Jews appear to
have disputed the matter seriously. &quot;Commonly quoted by Greek and Latin
Fathers as parts of Daniel,&quot; says Westcott (Smith's <i>D.B.</i>, ed. 2, I.
713b). So Sch&uuml;rer (II. III. 185), &quot;Julius Africanus alone among the
older Fathers disputes the canonicity of these fragments.&quot; See also
Bissell's admission on p. 448 of his <i>Apocrypha.</i> But Jerome seriously
called their canonicity in question (<i>Pr&aelig;f. in Dan.</i>), although he
included them in his translation, with a notice that they were not found
in the Hebrew. Polychronius, Theodore of Mopsuestia's brother, refused
to comment on this piece because it was not part of the original Daniel,
nor in the Syriac, <span xml:lang="el">&#959;&#8016; &#954;&#949;&#8150;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7961;&#946;&#961;&#945;&#970;&#954;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#7970; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#931;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#8150;&#962;
&#946;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#943;&#959;&#953;&#962;</span>. In this latter respect it keeps company with the Catholic
Epistles in the earliest stage of the Syriac N.T. (Carr, <i>St. James</i>, p.
XLVII). But it gained a place in the Peshitto (<i>D.C.B.</i> arts.
<i>Polychronius &amp; Polycarpus Chorepisc.</i>). Buhl (<i>Kanon und Text des
A.T.</i>, 1891, p. 52) says that the Nestorians recognise &quot;<span xml:lang="de">die
apokryphischen Zus&auml;tze zum Daniel als kanonisch;</span>&quot; and the Malabar
Christians regard this, with its two companions, &quot;as part <a class="pagenum" title="72" id="page72"></a>and parcel of
the book of Daniel.&quot; (Letter to the writer from F. Givargese, Principal
of Mar Dionysius' Seminary, Kottayam, 1902.) They formed part of the
Sahidic, and probably other Egyptian versions of Daniel, which may be as
early as century II.; as also of the Ethiopic and, seemingly, of the Old
Latin (Swete, <i>Introd.</i> 96, 107, 110).</p>

<p>It seems very difficult to prove that the Alexandrian Jews who used the
LXX did not regard this piece as canonically valid; though how they
reconciled their canon with the Palestinian one is not clear. Their
frequent communication with Palestinian Jews must have brought any
considerable discrepancy to the notice of both sides. F.C. Movers (<i xml:lang="la">Loci
quidam Hist. can. V.T.</i>, Breslau, 1842, pp. 20, 22) solves the
difficulty by imagining that this and the other Apocrypha were similarly
regarded both in Palestine and Alexandria, &quot;<span xml:lang="la">vix credibile est alios
libros a Palestinensibus inter profanos repositos ab Alexandrinis codici
sacro adscitos esse</span>.&quot; Acts ii. 10 proves the presence of Egyptian Jews
at Jerusalem for Pentecost, and vi. 9 that they had a synagogue there.
This close connection must have brought their religious practices to one
another's knowledge, and any differences, considered seriously
important, could hardly have failed to raise disputes. Now <a class="pagenum" title="73" id="page73"></a>Bleek
(<i>Introd. to O.T.</i>, II. 303, Engl. transl, Lond. 1869), says &quot;the
additions to Esther and Daniel were certainly looked upon by the
Hellenistic Jews in just the same light as the portions of the books
which are in the Hebrew.&quot; And this seems to have been done almost
without question, difficulty, or protest, although Alexandrian ideas
must have been, brought under the notice of the religious authorities in
Jerusalem. (<i>Cf.</i> Meyer's note on Acts vi. 9, and Jos. <i>cond. Ap.</i> I. 7,
as to regular intercourse between Palestinian and Alexandrian Jews.)</p>

<p>Professor, now Bishop, Ryle (<i>Can. of Script</i>, p. 157) thinks that the
amplification of Daniel, as of Esther, may have been tolerated because
Daniel was not then deemed canonical. But we must remember that
additional sections, though smaller in extent, appear in other books of
the LXX, of whose canonicity there appears to have been no question,
<i>e.g.</i> Job xlii. 17, Prov. xxiv. 22, I. Kings xvi. 28, this last being
taken from chap, xxii., though still left there. It has also been
suggested by Prof. Swete (<i>Introd.</i> p. 217) that the <span xml:lang="he">&#1499;&#1514;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;</span> were
probably attached to the canon by a looser bond at Alexandria than in
Palestine. However this may be, certain it is that this addition was
frequently quoted or referred to by early Christian writers as if part
of Dan. iii., without qualification <a class="pagenum" title="74" id="page74"></a>or sign of misgiving, as may be
seen in the quotations given in the chapter on 'Early Christian
Literature,' p. 76 <i>sqq.</i> Loisy's contention is a noticeable one (<i>A.T.</i>
p. 236), &quot;<span xml:lang="fr">Presque tous les auteurs catholiques, anciens et modernes, qui
ont emis des reserves touchant l'autorit&eacute; des deutero-canoniques, ont
regard&eacute;s ces livres comme inspir&eacute;s. Ils ne les croyaient pas bons pour
&eacute;tablir le dogme; mais cela est parfaitement compatible avec
l'inspiration, attendu qu'un livre peut-&ecirc;tre inspir&eacute; sans &ecirc;tre
dogmatique, et que s'il n'est pas dogmatique par son contenu il ne
saurait regler le dogme.</span>&quot; But this contention savours somewhat of clever
special pleading in order to evade the force of opposing evidence.
Loisy, however, for a Roman Catholic, is a wonderfully frank and fair
writer on these matters.</p>

<p>The explanation of the early mixture of non-canonical books with
canonical, by reason of their having been kept as separate papyrus rolls
in the same chest (Swete's <i>Introd.</i> p. 225), seems not an unlikely one
in the case of independent works such as Judith or Wisdom. But it
appears to lose its force in the case of additions such as these, or
those to the book of Esther. For the Song of the Three, Susanna, and Bel
and the Dragon are hardly likely to have had separate rolls assigned to
them; least of all this first <a class="pagenum" title="75" id="page75"></a>piece, which fits into the middle of the
accepted narrative, and is scarcely intelligible without it. Something
more therefore is wanting to explain the inclusion of those portions in
the Greek Bible.</p>

<p>Bengel's explanation (<i>Gnomon on Matt.</i> xxiv. 15), that the apocryphal
books in Latin Bibles were mixed with the canonical &quot;pro argumenti
affinitate,&quot; though distinguished at first by marks (afterwards omitted)
in the index, however likely so far as it goes, fails to account for
their admission on so slender a plea into Biblical MSS. at all.</p>

<p>If the additions are to be regarded with Streane (<i>Age of the Macc.</i> p.
161) as &quot;specimens of fiction,&quot; this one, more strongly than the other
two, shews the pre-existence of the canonical Daniel; but it is very
hard to understand how 'fiction' of this kind could be introduced into
the Bible with no general protest, and ultimately come to be treated as
of Divine authority; and this position is defended, even in these
critical days, by the greater number of Christians in the world.</p>

<p>When the Council of Trent made the canon of Scripture co-extensive with
the Vulgate, this, with the other additions, was of course included in
the decree. But in the Roman Church up to the present day attempts have
not been wanting to minimize <a class="pagenum" title="76" id="page76"></a>the force of this decision, which, if it
removes some difficulties, certainly introduces others. Outside the
Roman Church the position of these books, in common with the rest of the
Apocrypha, remains, as always, more or less insecure.</p>

<p>A. Scholz, in condemning the principle that Christians are tied to the
O.T. canon, rather amusingly supposes: &quot;<span xml:lang="de">Wenn Jemand sich bei den Juden
jetzt als Prophet geltend machen und ein Buch schreiben w&uuml;rdem so m&uuml;sste
es nach diesem Grundsatz von den Protestanten als kanonisch wohl
anerkannt werden</span>&quot; (<i>Esther und Susanna</i>, W&uuml;rzburg, 1892, p. 140). But
such argument is mere polemic, which cannot be seriously taken into
account in establishing the position of this or the other additions.
Something is needed much deeper and more convincing in character.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="77" id="page77"></a>Our 'apocryphon' is often referred to or quoted by early Fathers to a
remarkable extent, considering the brevity of the piece and its merely

occur in this form and order in v. 88 of the Song only.</p>

<p>CLEM. ALEX. (&#8224;220) in his <i>Eclog&aelig; prophetic&aelig;</i>, &sect; I, quotes several
verses with <span xml:lang="el">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#916;&#945;&#957;&#953;&#8052;&#955; &#947;&#941;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#960;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>.</p>

<p>HIPPOLYTUS (&#8224;230) recognizes the Song of the Three in his comment on
Daniel, <i>in loc.</i>, as well as in the Fragment preserved in the &quot;Catena
Patrum in Psalmos et Cantica&quot; (<i>Ante-Nic. Christian Lib.</i> p. 484). In

illustrative. (In Constantine's &quot;To the Convention of Saints,&quot; given in

<p>ATHANASIUS (&#8224;373) quoted the Song in <i>Ep. Pasch.</i> x. 3; and in <i>Agst.

<p>EPHREM SYRUS (&#8224;378). His commentary on Daniel does not embrace the

<p>JEROME (&#8224;420). In the <i>Comes</i> or Lectionary, the Song is made use of,
but probably the Comes is not really Jerome's. (<i>See</i> art. <i>Lectionary,
D.C.A.</i> 962a.)</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="80" id="page80"></a>THEODOERT (&#8224;457) in <i>Letter</i> CXLVI. quotes v. 63 amongst a string of
canonical texts; and also deals with the whole in his <i>Commentary on
Daniel</i>, as consolidated with chap. iii.</p>

<p>SEDULIUS (&#8224;460?). In his poem <i>De tribus pueris</i> there is nothing which
goes beyond the canonical record; but, strangely enough, in his
<i xml:lang="la">Miraculorum recapitulatio proedictorum</i> there are the lines</p>

<blockquote>
<p xml:lang="la">&quot;.... flagrante camino<br />
Servavit sub rore pios.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And equally in the prose version &quot;rore sydereo puerorum membra proluit
in camino.&quot; This shews a recognition of v. 50 (de la Bigne, <i>Bibliotheca
Patrum</i>, ed. 4, 1624, pp. 660, 661, 914).</p>

<p>VERECUNDUS (&#8224;552) wrote a comment on some of the ecclesiastical
canticles including the prayers of Azarias and Manasses (printed in
<i>Spicilegium, Solesmense,</i> Vol. IV.).</p>

<p>It is manifest, therefore, that Early Christian writers regarded the
Song as of much value and importance; were well acquainted with it, and
often quoted it in much the same manner as the canonical books.
Occasionally, however, a knowledge of it is not shewn where we should
have expected it; and in some cases we know that those who quoted it
denied, or doubted, its canonicity.</p>

<a class="pagenum" title="81" id="page81"></a>
<h5>Art.</h5>

<p>This Greek insertion in the book of Daniel has, on the whole, offered
less scope for the exercise of artistic talent than the history of
Susanna or even than that of Bel and the Dragon. The nature of its
contents, which consists in the main of a prayer and a song, reasonably
accounts for this paucity of illustration. It does not lend itself so
readily as its two companions to pictorial treatment. Nevertheless a
certain number of examples are not wanting.</p>

<p>Loisy in his <i>Canon of the O.T.</i> (1890, p. 95) remarks, &quot;<span xml:lang="fr">D&egrave;s avant le
IV<sup>e</sup> si&egrave;cle, on ornait les catacombes de peintures dont les sujets
avaient &eacute;t&eacute; fournis par Tobie et les fragments de Daniel.</span>&quot;</p>

<p>In a fresco from the cemetery of St. Hermes, the Three Children are
represented, each over a separate stoke-hole (or what looks like one),
with hands elevated as if in prayer or praise, most likely in reference
to v. 1 (24), (<i>see D.C.A.</i> art. <i>Fresco</i>, p. 700a). Another picture
of figures somewhat different, yet with outstretched hands, is given
from Bottari in the same Dictionary under art. <i>Furnace.</i> There are
sculptured representations of the Three on the high crosses at Moone
Abbey, and at Kells (M. Stokes, <i>Early Christian Art in Ireland</i>, Lond.
1887, II. 22).</p>

<p>In the Utrecht Psalter, over the Song are de<a class="pagenum" title="82" id="page82"></a>picted, as well as in other
places, the sun and the moon, very appropriately (<i>D.C.A.</i> art. <i>Sun</i>),
and in other illuminated Psalters, pictures of the Three in the furnace
are not uncommon. Thus Brit. Mus. MS. Additional 11836 has an
illumination of the furnace scene.</p>

<p>The under side of the wooden roof of Trinity College Chapel, Cambridge,
was painted about 1870 with the series of natural objects mentioned in
the Song proper, and with the words appertaining to each. A few extracts
from <i>Benedicite</i> are on scrolls in a modern window on the south side of
the chancel of St. James' Church, Bury St. Edmunds.</p>

<p>It is a little surprising that the series of objects named in this Song
has not been more frequently chosen for decorative purposes on roofs,
walls, or windows of ecclesiastical buildings, where a long series would
be appropriate. Perhaps the length of the series, and the difficulty of
making any but an arbitrary selection, has something to do with the
rarity of its appearance.</p>

<p>A set of not very satisfactory wood-engravings by MacWhirter and others,
one illustration to each verse, was published in a small book under the
title of the <i>Song of the Three Children illustrated</i> (London, 1887)</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="83" id="page83"></a>The verse &quot;O ye wells,&quot; etc., is said to be a frequent motto for the
floral well-dressings at Tissington, in Derbyshire, and elsewhere, on
Ascension Day; and a more appropriate one could hardly be found. But in
general the Song of the Three Children has not, for the reason given
above, and doubtless others besides, proved a popular subject in art.</p>
</div>

<div id="part2_12" class="section">
<h4>Liturgical Use.</h4>

<h5>General.</h5>

<p>There is, strange to say, no record of the Song's employment in this way
amongst the Jews. Statements sometimes made to the contrary in works on
the P.B., <i>e.g.</i> by W.G. Humphry, F. Procter, E. Daniel, and J.M. Fuller
(S.P.C.K. <i>Comm.</i> &quot;Introd. to the Song&quot;), &quot;in the <i>later</i> Jewish
Church,&quot; all appear to have originated in a misunderstanding of an
ambiguous sentence in Wheatley's <i>Rational Illustration</i> (1875, p. 143).
He says that it &quot;was an ancient hymn in the Jewish Church.&quot; But this
does not necessarily imply that it formed any part of Jewish services.
Nor did Wheatley probably intend to assert that it did. In point of fact
no evidence of such use is forthcoming, though it certainly would not
have been surprising if the Song had been so <a class="pagenum" title="84" id="page84"></a>used, at least among the
Hellenistic Jews. For as Rothstein says in Kautzsch's Apocrypha, like
Ps. cxxxvi. it is &quot;offenbar antiphonisch aufzufassen&quot; and
&quot;litaneiartig.&quot;</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the previous neglect, as it would seem, of this Song in
Jewish worship, its use by Christians dates from an early period. So Bp.
Gray (<i>O.T.,</i> p. 611) says, &quot;It was sung in the service of the primitive
Church;&quot; and Ball, &quot;the instinct of the Church, which early adopted the
<i>Benedicite</i> for liturgical use, was right&quot; (p. 307). Yet after it had
come into high esteem with Christians its chances of Jewish acceptance
would of course be largely diminished.</p>

<h5>Early.</h5>

<p>The liturgical use however was generally confined to the Song proper,
commencing with v. 29, and not always extending to the whole even of
that. In the Greek Church it is divided into two odes, said at Lauds on
two different days, vv. 3-34 (A.V. verses) forming one, and the
remainder of the Song the other (art. <i>Canticle D.G.A.</i>). In the
Ambrosian rite the first part only of the Song is used as an invitatory
before the Matin Psalms, under the title, <a class="pagenum" title="85" id="page85"></a>somewhat confusing to us, of
&quot;Benedictus&quot; (<i>D.G.A.</i> art. <i>Benedictus</i>).<a id="fnt27" href="#fn27"><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<div id="fn27" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt27">[27]</a> In the <i>Bk. of private Prayer</i> (Lond. 1887, p. 32), approved
by the
Lower House of Canterbury Convocation, these six verses are employed as
a separate canticle, under the title <i>Benedictus es</i>, probably suggested
by the Ambrosian rite above mentioned. The same canticle had also
appeared previously in <i>An Additional Order for Evening Prayer</i>, put
forth by the same authority in 1873, for singing after the first lesson.</p>
</div>

<p>For some reason not easy to assign, the Song, whether divided or entire,
has always been treated as a morning canticle, although there is nothing
in its words to suggest any time of day as specially appropriate.</p>

<p>Rufinus, according to Dr. Salmon (<i>Speaker's Comm.</i> Introduction to
Apocr. XXVIIb), speaks of the Song as &quot;sung on Festivals in the Church
of God.&quot; No reference is given to the passage quoted. But in Rufinus'
<i>Apol. in Hieron.</i> II. 35 we find the words, &quot;<span xml:lang="la">Omnis Ecclesia per orbem
terrarum... quicunque Hymnum trium puerorum in Ecclesia Domini
cecinerunt</span>,&quot; etc. Whether this be the passage Dr. Salmon intends or not,
it is at any rate sufficient to prove that the canticle was in use in
and before Rufinus' time, who is believed to have died in the year 410.</p>

<p>Bishop Barry (<i>Teacher's P.B.</i>) notes that it was used at Lauds (<span xml:lang="el">&#964;&#8056;
&#8004;&#961;&#952;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span>) in the East as well as in the West: and so Mr. Hotham in his
art. <i>Canticle</i> in <a class="pagenum" title="86" id="page86"></a><i>D.C.A.</i> In his art. <i>Psalmody</i>, however, no mention
is made of its Eastern use; but in the Western Church in the Gregorian
and its derived rites, including the Roman and cognate Breviaries, he
says, &quot;<span xml:lang="la">Benedictiones sive canticum trium puerorum</span>&quot; comes in Sunday
Lauds, and likewise in the Benedictine Psalter.</p>

<p>In the Ambrosian Psalter, while the first part &quot;Benedictus es&quot; is said
daily at Matins as stated above, the usual <i>Benedicite</i> is said at Lauds
on Sundays. In the Mozarabic Psalter an abridgment of both parts is said
at Lauds, but not &quot;in feriis.&quot; &quot;Benedictus es&quot; also comes on weekdays at
Prime. In the Mozarabic Missal <i>Benedicite</i> occurs in the service for
the first Sunday in Lent. In the use arranged by C&aelig;sarius of Aries
(&#8224;542) for the Gallican Church <i>Benedicite</i> was sung at Sunday Lauds.</p>

<p>Duchesne says (<i>Christian Worship</i>, Eng. tr. S.P.C.K. 1903, p. 195), &quot;In
the Gallican Mass between the Apostolic and the Evangelic lections the
Hymn of the Three Children was sung. It was known also by the name of
the Benediction (<i>Benedicite</i>) because in it the word 'Benedicite' is
continually repeated.&quot; In a note he adds, &quot;The Luxeuil Lectionary,
however, prescribes for the Nativity, <i>Daniel cum Benedictione, i.e.</i>,
the Hymn of the Three Children before the <a class="pagenum" title="87" id="page87"></a>Apostolic Lection. It is true
that in the Mass of <i>Clausum Paschale</i> it places it after this lection.&quot;</p>

<p>The fourth council of Toledo in 633, condemns the omission of the Song
at Mass, threatens with excommunication those who in Spain or Gaul (or
Gallicia, margin) persist in leaving it out, and styles it &quot;<span xml:lang="la">Hymnum
quoque trium puerorum in quo universa coeli terr&aelig;que creatura dominum
collaudat et quem ecclesia catholica per totum orbem diffusa celebrat</span>&quot;
(Mansi, <i>Concil.</i>, Florence, 1764, X. 623).</p>

<p>In the Roman Missal at the end of the Canon, the last Rubric is
&quot;<span xml:lang="la">Discedens ab Altari, pro gratiarum actione dicit Antiphonam Trium
Puerorum cum reliquis, ut habetur in principio Missalis</span>;&quot; where is given
as an antiphon before it these words, &quot;<span xml:lang="la">Trium puerorum cantemus hymnum
quem cantabant sancti in camino ignis, benedicentes Dominum</span>.&quot;</p>

<p>Possibly there is a reference to this Eucharistic use in Bishop
Wordsworth's Michaelmas Hymn, No. CII. in his <i>Holy Year</i>, 1864.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Angelic voices we shall hear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Joined in our jubilee,<br />
In this thy Church and echoing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Benedicite.</p>

<p>Angelic faces we shall see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Angelic songs o'erspread<br />
Above thy holy Altar, Lord,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;And Thou, the Living Bread.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="88" id="page88"></a>In the Saram Breviary (and in Cardinal Quignon's) <i>Benedicite</i> is a
canticle at Lauds on Sundays only. It is to be said without &quot;Glory&quot;;
&quot;<span xml:lang="la">dicatur sine Gloria Patri per totum annum quandocunque dicitur</span>&quot;
(Procter, p. 188); but a doxology is provided in the Roman Breviary,
&quot;<span xml:lang="la">Benedicamus Patrem et Filium cum Sancto Spiritu</span>,&quot; etc., and 'Amen' is
directed not to be said at the end. This doxology is said to have been
added by Pope Damasus I., who also transposed v. 56 to stand as the
finale of the Song (<i>see</i> James M'Swiney, <i>Psalms and Canticles</i>, Lond.
1901, p. 643). This R.C. writer calls the use of the canticle on Sundays
&quot;a thanksgiving for the resurrection of the Crucified, the earnest of
the glories wherewith nature is to be invested at His second coming.&quot;
But this sounds like an <i>ex post facto</i> reason for its appropriateness.</p>

<p><i>Benedicite</i> appears, at any rate sometimes, to have been said
subsequently to <i>Te Deum</i> after the election of an Abbot (<i>see</i> Jocelin
of Brakelond's <i>Chronicle</i>, Sir E. Clarke's ed., 1903, p. 38). It also
appears in the <i>Cantica</i> after the Psalter, between <i>Te Deum</i> and
<i>Benedictus</i>, in the Scottish <i>Breviarium Bothanum</i>, which is thought to
be of about 15th century (Lond. 1900).</p>

<p>Thus it is evident that the use of this hymn <a class="pagenum" title="89" id="page89"></a>became general at an early
period, and so continued, having never receded in Christian esteem as a
valued factor in public worship.</p>

<p>Besides the use of the Song, or part of it, as a canticle, verses or
small portions often occur in liturgies; <i>e.g.</i>, vv. 28-30 are borrowed
in an <span xml:lang="el">&#7960;&#954;&#966;&#974;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span> before the offertory prayers in the Liturgy of St.
James; at the censing of the Gospel in that of St. Mark; in a Byzantine
Liturgy of the ninth century in the second prayer of the faithful; in
that of St. Chrysostom immediately before the lections in the Mass of
the Catechumens; and v. 19 in the <span xml:lang="el">&#7960;&#960;&#943;&#954;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span> in that of the Coptic
Jacobites (Brightman's <i>Liturgies</i>, I. Oxf. 1896). In the Leonine
<i>Sacramentary</i>, in a Preface, Mense Junio, IIII. 1. 13, ad Fontem, the
last words of the Song appear to be cited &quot;<span xml:lang="la">plena sunt omnia saccula
misericordia tua</span>&quot; (Dr. Feltoe's ed., Camb. 1896, p. 31). The verse
&quot;<span xml:lang="la">Benedicite omnes angeli</span>&quot; occurs in a &quot;<span xml:lang="la">Communio</span>&quot; for Michaelmas in the
Rosslyn Missal; &quot;<span xml:lang="la">Benedictus es Domine patrum nostrorum</span>&quot; occurs in the
Mass of the Holy Trinity in the Westminster Missal as a &quot;gradale,&quot; also
in a Mass &quot;<span xml:lang="la">pro sponsis</span>&quot;, and other places (Hen. Bradshaw Soc., Lond.
1899, p. 70, 1897, p. 1239). v. 34 (56) occurs in the Sarum Compline
after the Creed, as also in the Roman.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="90" id="page90"></a>In the Greek Euchologion a great part of the Song is embodied, with
other Scripture odes, in what is styled &quot;the Canon at Great Matins in
the All Night Vigil&quot; (<i>Euchology</i>, translated by G.V. Shann,
Kidderminster, 1891, p. 34).</p>

<h5>Later English Use.</h5>

<p>Burbidge (<i>Liturgies and Offices of the Church</i>, 1885, p. 268), gives a
number of instances of the use of <i>Benedicite</i> in foreign service books,
and says, &quot;In other churches <i>Benedicite</i> has been held in higher esteem
than amongst ourselves.&quot; Esteem for it has never been entirely lacking,
however, as its prominence in the P.B. shews.</p>

<p>In a Prymer of circ. 1400, as given by Maskell (<i>Mon. rit.</i> 1882, Vol.
III. p. 21), <i>Benedicite</i> occurs in Matins, beginning &quot;Alle werkis of
the Lord, bless ye to the Lord: herie ye and overhize ye him in all
time.&quot; On the same page, note 49, he gives a quotation from <i>Gemma
animae</i>, II. 53, &quot;<span xml:lang="la">canticum trium puerorum est festivius et ideo in
omnibus festis dicitur</span>.&quot; Also in his <i>Append, to Prymer</i>, p. 243,
another version is given, from Bodl. Douce MS. 275, fol. 9b: &quot;Alle
werkes of the Lord, bless ye the Lord: praise and overheie ye him in to
the worldes.&quot; There was an authorized translation into <a class="pagenum" title="91" id="page91"></a>Welsh early in
the 14th century, according to H. Zimmer (<i>Urtext und Uebersetz</i>,
Leipzig, 1897, p. 172), together with <i>Magnificat, Benedictus</i>, and
several Psalms, evidently for liturgical purposes.</p>

<p>In the P.B. of 1549 the use of the <i>Benedicite</i> as a substitute for the
<i>Te Deum</i> was confined to Lent &quot;all the which time&quot; its recital was
obligatory. It has been suggested by W.G. Wyon (<i>Letter to &quot;Guardian,&quot;</i>
May 14, 1902) that medi&aelig;val devotion read into it an allegoric meaning
of deliverance from temptations and dangers of this naughty world, and
this made the Song suitable for Lent. He also suggests that the 'Oratio'
of the Roman Missal in the 'Gratiarum actio' after Mass, which contains
it, shews us its suitability for penitential seasons indirectly, &quot;Deus
qui tribus,&quot; etc. No doubt hope of deliverance from fierce spiritual
perils may be in Lent a proper frame of mind; but this attempt to prove
the <i>Benedicites</i> special appropriateness to that season is more
ingenious than satisfying. It is strained and far-fetched. Compare what
is said above (p. 88), where M'Swiney is cited as shewing in similar
style its special appropriateness to Sunday. The tone of the canticle is
unmistakeably joyful, and the 1549 rubric disappeared in 1552, leaving
<a class="pagenum" title="92" id="page92"></a><i>Benedicite</i> as a simple alternative to the <i>Te Deum</i>, at any time
according to the taste of the officiant. And so it still remains, though
often preferred to the <i>Te Dewm</i> during Lent. Septuagesima and Trinity
XXI. are, on account of their first lessons, fitting Sundays for its
use; nor is it by any means unsuitable for a harvest festival. An
entirely different kind of reason for its Lenten suitability is provided
by H.P. Cornish (<i>Notes on P.B.</i>, Evans, Redditch, n.d., p. 17). Lent,
he says, is the time &quot;when all nature begins to wake from its Lenten
sleep&quot;: hence its appropriateness in spring. It is questionable,
however, whether medi&aelig;val liturgical authorities paid much attention to
the natural seasons of the year; and the variety of 'reasons' proves the
difficulty of discovering a really conclusive one. The idea that the
<i>Benedicite</i> is consonant with Lenten feelings is singularly out of
accord with the opinion expressed as to its character as being
'festivius' in the <i>Gemma animae</i>, given above, p. 90. Indeed it can
hardly be disputed that its tone is joyful. But though its special
aptness for a fasting-time is not easy to make out clearly, few
unprejudiced people will dissent from the opinion of Freeman as to its
scope when he writes, that &quot;though wanting in the <a class="pagenum" title="93" id="page93"></a>grand structure of
the <i>Te Deum</i>, in point of range it is in no way inferior&quot; (<i>Divine
Service</i>, Lond. 1855, I. 356).</p>

<p>In the scheme for the revision of the Prayer-Book in William III.'s
reign it was actually arranged to expunge <i>Benedicite</i>, and to
substitute Ps. cxlviii. It would have been extruded in good company
however, as <i xml:lang="la">Magnificat</i> and <i xml:lang="la">Nunc Dimittis</i> were to be replaced by
psalms in a similar way. Happily the deplorable proposals of 1689 came
to nothing. But strange to say, previously to this, in the Laudian
Scottish Prayer-Book, Psalm xxiii. had been substituted for
<i>Benedicite</i>. In England, however, in 1662, the Church, taught by the
persecution of the Commonwealth, declined &quot;to appoint some psalm or
scripture hymn instead of the apocryphal <i>Benedicite</i>&quot;, as demanded by
the Puritans at the Savoy Conference (Procter, <i>P.B.</i>, 1872, p. 119).</p>

<p>At a rather earlier period, Dean Boys of Canterbury, in his quaint
<i>Prayer-Book Notes</i> (1615?) says: &quot;I finde this hymne less martyred than
the rest, and therefore dismisse it, as Christ did the woman (John
viii.), 'Where be thine accusers? Hath no man condemned thee? No more
doe I; goe thy way.'&quot;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="94" id="page94"></a>At least three English metrical renderings of <i>Benedicite</i> exist, one
of the 18th and two of the 19th century, by J. Merrick, J.S. Blackie,
and Richard Wilton respectively. The first of these writers, who expands
freely, concludes with a stanza designed to put the Song unmistakeably
into the mouths of the Three:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let us, who now impassive stand,<br />
Plac'd by the Tyrant's stern Command<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the fiery Blaze,<br />
(While thus we triumph in the Flame)<br />
Rise, and our Maker's Love proclaim<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In hymns of endless praise.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The objection that in using this hymn we pray to angels and heavens, to
ice and snow, etc., shews how hard it is to find reasonable cause of
complaint against its use. (<i>See</i> p. 62).</p>

<p>The whole canticle was however actually omitted in the P.B. printed at
Oxford in 1796, an edition notorious for the liberties taken with the
book in many ways (A.J. Stephens' <i>P.B.</i>, Lond. 1849).<a id="fnt28" href="#fn28"><sup>[28]</sup></a> <a class="pagenum" title="95" id="page95"></a>The last
verse, &quot;O Ananias,&quot; etc., which was omitted in the United States' P.B.
is, as well as the above, dealt with under 'Theology,' p. 64.</p>

<div id="fn28" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt28">[28]</a> Its use declined in the 18th century as is shewn by P. Barclay
(<i>Letter to People of Scotland on Comm. Pr.</i>, Lond. 1713, p. 36), who
says, &quot;Benedicite is very good; but because it is seldom or never used,
I don't insist upon it.&quot; P. Waldo (<i>Commentary on Liturgy</i>, 1775, p.
98), also deplores its disuse. And even in the 19th century C. Chaplin
(<i>Benedicite</i>, 1879, p. 11) says, &quot;In a few churches it seems to be
banished from the service altogether.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>In an <i>Altar Service Manual</i>, ed. 1837, which was very popular in the
middle of the 19th century, by S. Isaacson, certain extracts from the
<i>Benedicite</i>, with presumably original additions, are formed into what
is called &quot;the canticle&quot; in an &quot;Evening Liturgy for use after Holy
Communion.&quot; The five added verses, in rather unrhythmical English, are
modelled in imitation of the Song, <i>e.g.</i> &quot;O ye who have partaken of the
Holy Communion, bless ye the Lord: praise Him and magnify Him for ever.&quot;</p>

<p>The Song of the Three Children is, with other canticles, frequently
found in appendices to both Greek and Latin Psalters. And on this
account it is included sometimes in commentaries on the Psalter, as in
that of de Muis (&#8224;644), Louvain, 1770, beginning with v. 51, &quot;tunc hi
tres quasi ex uno ore laudabant,&quot; etc. It stands in this book between
Hezekiah's and Jonah's prayers. In the medi&aelig;val Psalters, <i>Benedicite</i>
may constantly be found, though its place in the series of canticles
varies considerably.</p>

<p>Many of the LXX MSS. too contain these <a class="pagenum" title="96" id="page96"></a>canticles, or some of them,
repeated from their regular places in the text, such as Alexandrinus and
the Veronese and Turin Psalters; of these the first has vv. 26 to 45 and
52 to 58, as two separate canticles between the Prayer of Manasses and
Magnificat; the second, vv. 52 to 90 after Magnificat as its last
canticle; and the third has vv. 26 to 45, 52 to 56, and 57 to 90 as
three separate canticles between the P. of M. and Benedictus. In each
case, it will be observed, the narrative portion is naturally excluded.</p>

<p>In the first and third of these MSS., A. and T., it may here be noted
that there is a non-biblical Morning Hymn, <span xml:lang="el">&#8029;&#956;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#7953;&#969;&#952;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#962;</span>, a kind of
Eastern &quot;Gloria in excelsis,&quot; which contains an apparent extract from
vv. 29, 30 (52), or v. 3 (26) of our Apocryphon, in line 34 of the hymn.
Very nearly the same words occur in Tobias' song (Tob. viii. 5), which
curiously enough (in common with the song of Deborah), is not included
in these canticles. Doubtless it was not in ecclesiastical use; but the
reason why the Christian Church abstained from availing herself of it
for choral purposes is not evident; any more than why the Jewish Church
abstained from the use of <i>Benedicite</i>.</p>

<p>Although the employment of <i>Benedicite</i> in the <a class="pagenum" title="97" id="page97"></a>services of the Church
is interesting, as shewing the value set upon, and the use made of, this
canticle, it reflects little or no light on its origin, or indeed on any
of the heads under which it has been previously discussed.</p>
</div>

<div id="part2_13" class="section">
<h4>&quot;Example Of Life And Instruction Of Manners.&quot;</h4>

<p>The conduct of Azarias and its results shew us the <i>value of Prayer</i>
made by those under persecution. He led the way, and his comrades joined
him.</p>

<p>Azarias is not so taken up with the wrongs of himself and his fellows as
to forget the wrongs which his own nation had done; therefore his prayer
commences with a <i>humble Confession</i>. Then he relies on the great
promises of the past (vv. 12, 13). It may be thought that <i>Humility</i> is
also shewn in the Song by the Three putting their own names in the last
place of the series. But another cause may have contributed to the
choice of this order; for, so far as animal life is concerned, the Song
follows the order of Gen. i., bringing in human beings last, not as
being least important, but as forming the crown of creation.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="98" id="page98"></a>Although Nebuchadnezzar is severely spoken of in v. 9, A.V. (and in iv.
27 of the canonical book 'sins and iniquities' are attributed to
Nebuchadnezzar), there is great <i>Self-restraint</i> shewn in wishing for
retribution (vv. 20, 21); and indeed it is asked that he and his
servitors may be brought to the knowledge of God (v. 22).</p>

<p>The pleasure of <i>Thanksgiving and Praise</i> on delivery are exemplified by
the Three in the production of the Song itself. As soon as ever their
prayer was answered, before they emerged from the furnace, they united
their voices in thanking God with a glow of fervid faith, recognizing in
Him the universal Lord and Benefactor.</p>

<p>They sang in harmonious accord their song of praise at once (v. 28).
Though staunchly refusing to worship in a wrong way, they were very
ready to do so in a right, and lost no time in proving it, publicly and
before all creation. As de Muis (&#8224;1644) says in his <i>Comm. in Psalmos</i>
(Louvain, 1770, II. 705), &quot;Ut calamitatibus tanquam igne probatur;
fidelis animus non modo non deficiat sed etiam animata inanimaque omnia
ad Dei laudes provocet.&quot; Eager to honour God, they join in unreserved
devotion.</p>

<p>Their <i>Reliance upon God</i> is obviously great. <a class="pagenum" title="99" id="page99"></a>To Him they turn in their
martyrdom with prayer and praise; to Him they address themselves with
the heart and voice of sure conviction. He is their unfailing resource.</p>

<p>A <i>Love of Nature</i>, as created by the same hand as ourselves, is very
apparent in this canticle; there is a thorough fellow-feeling with
natural objects, as derived from, and responding to, the same Almighty
source. This love of nature appears in Holy Scripture most strongly, as
here, in the poetical books, and hardly anywhere does it take a deeper
tone than in this canticle.</p>

<p>This is in general simply <span xml:lang="el">&#931;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#940;&#957;&#957;&#945;</span>, as in the true LXX.</p>

<p>In Cod. A (&#920;) it is designated at the end <span xml:lang="el">&#8005;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#945;'</span>, our chap. i. being
<span xml:lang="el">&#8005;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#946;'</span>, and so on. It is therefore included in the number of the
visions.<a id="fnt29" href="#fn29"><sup>[29]</sup></a> <a class="pagenum" title="104" id="page104"></a><span xml:lang="el">&#8013;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span> also occurs in the title of Holmes and Parsons'
cursive 235.</p>

<div id="fn29" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt29">[29]</a> It is stated in Dr. Swete's <i>Introd.</i> (1902, p. 260) that
Susanna
is excluded from the visions, Dan. i. 1 commencing the first of them.
But this is not borne out by the 'apparatus criticus' to his Greek text,
where i. 1 in A and Q begins &#8003;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#946;', and
&#8005;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#945;' is the
subscription of Susanna in A.</p>
</div>

<p>In the Syriac of Heraclius (=W<sub>2</sub> of Ball, pp. 323a, 330a) it is entitled
&quot;The Book of the child Daniel,&quot; or &quot;The Book of little Daniel&quot; (Churton,
3896). This last title also seems applied to Bel and the Dragon in a
Nestorian list mentioned by Churton (on the same page), and in Ebed
Jesu's list of Hippolytus' works (<i>D.G.B.</i> art. <i>Hippolytus</i>, p. 104a),
When applied to Bel and the Dragon, however, 'little' must refer to the
size of the book, and not, as is usually understood when it heads
Susanna, to Daniel's youthful age. To this Bar Hebr&aelig;us (&#8224;1286), in his
Scholia on Susanna, expressly attributes it (ed. A. Heppner, Berlin,
1888, p. 18). He also remarks that neither Syriac version is equal to
the Greek.</p>

<p>&quot;The Judgments of Daniel,&quot; <span xml:lang="el">&#916;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#961;&#943;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962; &#916;&#945;&#957;&#953;&#942;&#955;</span>, is a good title given by
Arnald, by Churton (p. 390), and by Westcott (Smith's <i>D.B.</i> art.
<i>Additions to Daniel</i>, ed. 1, 3966, ed. 2, 713b), none of whom specify
any source or authority for it, Arnald alone giving the Greek. It may be
traced back, however, through Sabatier to Flaminius Nobilius, who
writes, &quot;<span xml:lang="la">In multis [vetustis libris] inscribitur Daniel, in qui<a class="pagenum" title="105" id="page105"></a>busdam
Susanna, in aliquo <span xml:lang="el">&#948;&#953;&#940;&#954;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#916;&#945;&#957;&#953;&#942;&#955;</span>, Judicium Daniel</span>&quot; (Append, to Bp.
Walton's <i>Polyglott</i>, Lond. 1657, p. 191). He gives no information as to
what this 'certain' copy at the end of his descending climax might be in
which he had found this title; nor does it quite agree with the plural
form in which Arnald gives it, presumably with regard to the double
sentence passed by Daniel. Holmes and Parsons give no such reading, and
no one now seems able to identify the 'liber' intended by Flaminius.
Delitzsch (<i>di Hab. Vita</i>, etc., Lips. 1842, p. <i>25n</i>) says that &quot;<span xml:lang="la">Unus
Cod. qui ex coenobiis montis Athos advectus est</span>&quot; gives the title <span xml:lang="el">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054;
&#964;&#8134;&#962; &#931;&#969;&#963;&#940;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#962;</span>.</p>

<p>As this piece describes one episode only in Susanna's life, &quot;the History
of Susanna&quot; in both A.V. and R.V. is not a good title. 'History' and
'story,' however, were not so clearly differentiated in English formerly
as they are now. Possibly this title was taken from Jerome, who speaks
of &quot;Susann&aelig; historiam&quot; twice in his Preface to Daniel. It is given also
in Syr. W&#8321;. In Article VI., and in the &quot;Names and Order of the Books&quot; in
A.V., it takes the form, &quot;Story of Susanna.&quot;</p>

<p>The name <span xml:lang="he">&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1476;&#1513;&#1463;&#1473;&#1504;&#1464;&#1468;&#1492;</span> is so eminently fitted to the subject of the story
as to suggest its intentional <a class="pagenum" title="106" id="page106"></a>choice; and, so far, would tell in favour
of the allegoric, and against the historic, nature of the piece<a id="fnt30" href="#fn30"><sup>[30]</sup></a>. Or
even supposing the piece to be historic, the name may have been assumed
in order to avoid identification of the heroine. The word occurs in its
masculine form, <span xml:lang="he">&#1513;&#1461;&#1473;&#1513;&#1464;&#1473;&#1503;</span>, in I. Chron. ii. 31, 34, 35; and in its
feminine form in II. Chron. iv. 5, Cant. ii. 1, 2 (here in a phrase most
readily lending itself as a motto for the tale), and Hos. xiv. 5. The
place Shushan, too, is thought to have been named from the abundance of
lilies which grew there. This name, derived from the plant world, is
paralleled by that of Habakkuk in the companion story of Bel and the
Dragon, according to Marti on Hab. i. 1 (<i>Hand-Commentar,</i> T&uuml;bingen,
1904).</p>

<div id="fn30" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt30">[30]</a> The name is used of an actual woman in St. Luke viii. 3.</p>
</div>

<h5>Position.</h5>

<p>In Cod. Chisianus, and in the Vulgate, Susanna forms chap. xiii. of
Daniel. So also in the Syro-Hexaplar version (Ball, p. 330b). Cajetanus
Bugati (<i>Syriac Daniel</i>, Milan, 1788, p. 163), endeavours to explain
this (against Michaelis) by supposing Susanna to have been removed from
its original place at the beginning of the book.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="107" id="page107"></a>In Codd. A, B, Q, Susanna stands at the beginning, before our chap. i.
of Daniel. This is its position also in the Old Latin, and in the Arabic
versions (Ball, p. 330b). Rothstein in Kautzsch (p. 172) thinks that
this was not its original place, but the one in which Theodotion fixed
it, or perhaps that which found favour when Theodotion's translation was
substituted for LXX. And this position appears to be contemplated by the
A.V. and R.V. titles, &quot;set apart from the beginning of,&quot; etc. Driver,
however, thinks (<i>Comm. on Dan.</i>, p. xviii.) that the chap. xiii.
position (before Bel and the Dragon) was perhaps its original place.
&quot;The fact that it contains an anecdote of Daniel's youth might readily
have led to its subsequent transference to the beginning of the book.&quot;</p>

<p>St. Hippolytus, a writer subsequent to Theodotion, evidently regards it
as the commencement of the book (Sch&uuml;rer, <i>H.J.P.</i> ii. iii., 185).
Flaminius Nobilius in his &quot;Notae,&quot; as given in the Appendix to Bryan
Walton's <i>Polyglott</i>, writes, &quot;<span xml:lang="la">H&aelig;c Susannas historia in omnibus
vetustis libris est principium Danielis, quemadmodum etiam apud S.
Athan. in Synopsi</span>.&quot; This Synopsis is now considered to be of
post-Athanasian date; and the position which its writer <a class="pagenum" title="108" id="page108"></a>gives to
Susanna in &sect; 41 does not look quite consistent with that he gives
afterwards in &sect; 74 (<i>see</i> 'Canonicity,' p. 157).</p>

<p>Although in the Vulgate this moveable fragment forms Daniel xiii.,
Jerome, notwithstanding, in his Preface names these additions in the
order, Susanna, The Three, Bel and the Dragon; yet in the immediately
following &quot;capitula Danihelis,&quot; it stands as in the text after chap.
xii. This clearly points to some uncertainty as to its proper place.</p>

<p>The statements made by E.L. Curtis at the end of art. <i>Daniel</i> in
Hastings' <i>B.D.</i>, that this and Bel and the Dragon are separate books in
the LXX, have question marks justly affixed to them. In the Jacobite
Syriac, Susanna is joined with Judith, Ruth, and Esther, as a &quot;Female
Book&quot; (<i>Urtext und Uebersetz.</i> p. 230). Gwynn says (D.C.B. art.
<i>Thecla</i>, IV. 895b), that in &quot;Syriac O.T.'s these are usually placed
together and classed as the four books of the 'Book of Women.'&quot;</p>

<p>Yet another position is suggested by J. F&uuml;rst (quoted in Bissell, p.
444), who thinks its proper place is after Dan. i. 20. This is a very
plausible conjecture, but evidence to support it is at present wanting.
A slight confirmation of it however is <a class="pagenum" title="109" id="page109"></a>afforded by the <i>Byzantine Guide
to Painting</i> (<i>see</i> 'Art,' p. 171); and by the position given by Sulpicius
Severus to his epitome of the story (<i>see</i> 'Christian Literature,' p.
167). E. Philippe (Vigouroux, <i>Dict.</i> II. 1267a) attempts to account for
its removal from, or want of position in, the Massoretic Daniel, &quot;<span xml:lang="fr">parce
qu'elle est infamante pour les juges d'Israel</span>,&quot; obviously adopting
Origen's reason (<i>see</i> 'Canonicity,' p. 157) which is not a very
satisfactory one.</p>

<p>All things considered, the position of Susanna in the A.V. as a detached
piece, along with Bel and the Dragon, is as suitable as any which have
been suggested. For its original place cannot now, from the information
in our hands, be determined with absolute certainty.</p>
</div>

<div id="part3_2" class="section">
<h4>Date And Place Of Writing.</h4>

<h5>Date.</h5>

<p>Susanna is deemed by J.M. Fuller (<i>Speaker's Comm., Introd. to Dan.</i>,
221a) to be probably the oldest of the three additions. This opinion is
however by no means universally accepted.</p>

<p>If a Semitic original really existed, it no doubt preceded the Greek
texts. R.C. opinion (<i>e.g.</i> Dereser, <a class="pagenum" title="110" id="page110"></a>quoted by Bissell, p. 444), as that
of all who regard the booklet as canonical, treats it as part of Daniel,
and therefore whatever date is assigned to that book is made to apply to
this also. Professor A.A. Bevan (<i>Comm. on Dan.</i>, Camb. 1892, p. 45)
thinks that this piece and Bel and the Dragon &quot;appear to have been
circulated independently before they were incorporated with the book of
Daniel.&quot; C.J. Ball ascribes the origin of the piece to the struggles
between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, B.C. 94-89 (p. 330a). But to
attribute it thus to the outcome of these quarrels, brings the original
down to a later date than is at all probable, in view of its
incorporation with the LXX.<a id="fnt31" href="#fn31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> Nor does the bitterness of those
disputes seem stamped with sufficient strength upon the document itself
to compel us to see in them its period of origin.</p>

<div id="fn31" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt31">[31]</a> Kothstein (Kautzsch i., 176) gives the first quarter of the last
century B.C. as the latest possible date for the LXX version of Daniel.
Exceedingly little time therefore would be allowed, on Ball's theory,
for the original publication, the translation, and the incorporation
into the Alexandrian canon, of this Susanna-book.</p>
</div>

<p>J.T. Marshall (Hastings' <i>D.B.</i> IV., 631-2) conjectures that the latter
part of the story arose out of Simon ben Shetach's efforts, about 100
B.C., to get the law as to witnesses in criminal cases altered. <a class="pagenum" title="111" id="page111"></a>This
view is perhaps a trifle more probable than Ball's.</p>

<p>As to the true LXX text, Bissell (p. 444) rather inclines to deem it to
have been from the first a part of the LXX. So Pusey, quoted by Churton
(p. 389), says that it is &quot;admitted to have been contemporary with the
LXX version;&quot; and W. Selwyn (<i>D.B.</i> III., p. 1210a) thinks that this,
with the other additions, was &quot;early incorporated with the LXX.&quot;
Rothstein in Kautzsch, very hesitatingly and with much caution, suggests
(I., p. 178) the second century before Christ.</p>

<p>On the other hand, A. Kamphausen (<i>Encyclop. Bibl.</i> I. 1013) writes,&quot;
When [Daniel] first began to be translated by the Egyptian Jews into
Greek, the legends of Susanna and Bel and the Dragon, which may very
well have had an independent circulation, had certainly not as yet been
taken up into it.... We cannot tell at what date it was that these
apocryphal additions (which are contained in all MSS. that have reached
us), were taken up into the Greek and Syriac Daniel.&quot; How he knows so
&quot;certainly&quot; that they were not in it at the period named, he does not
explain; and before this positive statement can be unreservedly accepted
strong proof is wanted.</p>

<p>As to Theodotion's version, there is no reason <a class="pagenum" title="112" id="page112"></a>to suppose that the
portion consisting of Susanna differs in date from the rest of the book.
It may probably be assigned to the latter half of the second century
A.D. Behrmann, in Nowack's <i>Hand Kommentar</i>, p. xxx. says, &quot;um 150.&quot;</p>

<p>Most writers on this subject, such as Westcott, Streane, and Marshall,
as well as some of those previously mentioned, markedly avoid any
approach to definite dates as to the original, or as to the LXX Greek.
And justly so; for the evidence in our hands does not, unfortunately,
admit of anything closer than a &quot;period&quot; being safely fixed. The
materials we have are not sufficiently precise for closer approximation
with any decree of security. Rothstein (Kautzsch, I., p. 178) very
wisely says, &quot;<span xml:lang="de">Nat&uuml;rlich lasst sich mit irgend welcher Sicherheit &uuml;ber
diese Frage nichts ausmachen.</span>&quot; With this, until further evidence be
forthcoming, it is well to agree.</p>

<h5>Place.</h5>

<p><i>Of Original.</i> As to the place of origin nearly every writer on Susanna
is silent except Scholz, who (p. 147) favours a non-Alexandrian
birthplace, giving a preference to the land of the Captivity. And if we
assume, as he does, a Semitic original, Babylonia <a class="pagenum" title="113" id="page113"></a>is no doubt its
probable birthplace, or, failing that, Palestine.</p>

<p>It might appear, if the trees named could be botanically identified with
a reasonable degree of certainty, that a valuable sign would thus be
given of the place of origin. But inasmuch as Joacim's park or garden
would be a likely place for the cultivation of exotics, perhaps no safe
theory could be built upon the identification of the trees, unless they
were shewn to be such as would not live in the climate of the country
suggested.</p>

<p>There is no trace of Alexandrian philosophy or speculation, nor of
commercial interests, some of which generally betray themselves in
writings of Alexandrian origin. And the same may be said of the Song of
the Three, and Bel and the Dragon. But in such short pieces it is not
wise to build much on the absence of these traces.</p>

<p><i>Of LXX Greek.</i> That this was made at Alexandria admits of little doubt.
From the similarity of style, too, it would appear that the translator
(or editor) was identical with the translator of the canonical Daniel.
This is the opinion of Rothstein (in Kautzsch, I. 178). Sch&uuml;rer
(<i>H.J.P.</i> II. III.), who denies the existence of a Semitic original,
classes <a class="pagenum" title="114" id="page114"></a>this (with the other additions) not in his
'Palestinian-Jewish,' but in his 'Graeco-Jewish' section.</p>

<p>The mention of Sidon in v. 56 (where &#920; has Canaan) may perhaps suggest a
writer in the original, whatever language he may have used, who was
connected with the north of Palestine. But it is quite as probable that
the writer (or translator) had some idea of Gen. x. 15 in his mind,
&quot;Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn.&quot; After him, according to Josephus
(<i>Ant.</i> I. VI. 2), the city was named: <span xml:lang="el">&#931;&#953;&#948;&#974;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#962; &#8003;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#972;&#955;&#953;&#957; &#7952;&#960;&#974;&#957;&#957;&#956;&#959;&#957;
&#7956;&#954;&#964;&#953;&#963;&#949;&#957; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8135; &#934;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#943;&#954;&#8131;, &#931;&#953;&#948;&#8060;&#957; &#948;&#8125; &#8017;&#966;&#8125; &#7961;&#955;&#955;&#942;&#957;&#969;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#949;&#8150;&#964;&#945;&#953;.</span> It is worth
noticing that in St. Matt. xi. 21 our Lord speaks of the city more
favourably.</p>

<p><i>Of Theodotion's Greek.</i> Of the 'provenance' of the Greek version
bearing Theodotion's name very little is known. But Ephesus may be
suggested as not altogether improbable with regard to what little we
know of Theodotion's life. If we take the Revelation of St. John, too,
as having been written at Ephesus, this will accord well with the use
made of Theodotion's version of Daniel in that book. Or if Theodotion
made use, in whole or in part, of some previous version, as seems
certain, this fact would not at all militate against St. John at Ephesus
having <a class="pagenum" title="115" id="page115"></a>also made use of the same earlier version. And it is quite
possible that this version may have been of Alexandrian origin, although
worked up by Theodotion elsewhere.</p>

<p>Whatever the place of origin may have been, it is very remarkable that a
version by one who was either a Jew or a heretic Christian should have
been preferred to the LXX of Daniel and the Additions so as practically
to supersede it. Prof. J.J. Blunt describes Theodotion as one who
&quot;attempts to wrest the Hebrew from the cause of the Gospel&quot; (<i>Christian
Church</i>, p. 129). This was indicated by Iren&aelig;us, III. xxiii. 1. If,
however, the previous version used by him was due to a pre-Christian
Jew, this may have smoothed the way for its acceptance among Christians.
For Jews B.C. and Jews A.D. were regarded by the Church, as was natural,
in very different lights, and their writings likewise.</p>
</div>

<div id="part3_3" class="section">
<h4>Authorship.</h4>

<p>Like some other of the apocryphal books, this is a traditional story of
great popularity. It is not necessary to suppose that its author's name
has been lost from the title, as it may always have been anonymous. The
nature of its contents would not be <a class="pagenum" title="116" id="page116"></a>unlikely to give offence to the
Sanhedrin, and therefore a motive for anonymity is not far to seek.</p>

<p>Bishop Gray (<i>Introd. to O.T.</i> p. 613) seems, as he often does, to hit
the mark, as nearly as we can tell, when he deems it to be &quot;by some Jew
who invented the history, or collected its particulars from traditionary
relations in praise of Daniel.&quot; This observation is little more than
paraphrased by J.H. Blunt, when he writes (<i>in loc.</i>) &quot;probably inserted
into LXX from some ancient Jewish authority.&quot; The variations of text
certainly suggest an oral tradition, perhaps even more strongly than in
Bel and the Dragon.</p>

<p>Bissell says that Susanna &quot;contains nothing which might not have come
from the pen of a Hellenist&quot; (p. 445); and Westcott sees in this and
other additions &quot;the hand of an Alexandrian writer&quot; (Smith's <i>D.B.</i> ed.
2 I. 714a), but thinks it not unlikely that he worked up earlier
traditions. Certainly v. 22 seems to shew that the author of the Greek
of &#920; was evidently acquainted with the LXX of II. Sam. xxiv. 14. &quot;<span xml:lang="de">Wer
die Susanna (in Walton's <i>Polygl.</i> 4) nach Theodot. frei &uuml;bersetzt hat</span>,&quot;
says Nestle, &quot;<span xml:lang="de">wissen wir nicht</span>&quot; (<i xml:lang="de">Urtext und &uuml;bersetz.</i> 236).</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="117" id="page117"></a>It is noteworthy that Josephus shews no acquaintance with this or the
other additions, though he makes some use of other uncanonical legends
of Daniel (<i>Jud. Ant.</i> X., 10, 1; 11, 6 and 7). Sch&uuml;rer in Hauck's
<i>Encylop.</i> (I. 639), thinks Susanna and Bel and the Dragon may well
originally have had independent existences. If so, this might help to
explain Josephus' disregard of them.</p>

<p>It is a reasonable inference from v. 57, that the author was a Jew in
the strictest sense, and not from one of the ten tribes. Yet it should
not escape notice that in v. 48 &quot;Israel&quot; is apparently used for the
entire people, including all the tribes.<a id="fnt32" href="#fn32"><sup>[32]</sup></a> The invidious contrast
between the Israelitish and Jewish women is omitted in what Dr. Salmon
calls, &quot;the second Syriac recension&quot; of Susanna, termed erroneously at
one time &quot;the Harklensian&quot; (<i>Speaker's Comm.</i>, p. xlvi.). The contrast
in v. 56 between Israel and Canaan is made into a stinging reproach, but
is hardly to be understood literally as to the Elder's family descent.</p>

<div id="fn32" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt32">[32]</a> If not, as Bissell in his note elegantly puts it, &quot;it would
be a
bungling lapsus penn&aelig;.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>J. Kennedy in <i>Daniel from a Christian standpoint</i> (p. 55), says of this
and the other Additions <a class="pagenum" title="118" id="page118"></a>that there is &quot;no means of determining when,
where, or by whom written.&quot; He adds (p. 56), &quot;those who conceived and
wrote the additions were both intellectually and spiritually incapable
of appreciating the book [of Daniel] and its contents,&quot; and he concludes
that they &quot;belong to different ages and to entirely different conditions
of thought.&quot; This estimate is a much too severe one, and very different
from the opinion formed by some other equally qualified judges. The fear
lest a favourable opinion of the quality of these pieces should lend any
countenance to the Tridentine decree as to the Apocrypha, or seem to
weaken the Protestant position with regard to them, appears to have
operated, consciously or unconsciously, in shaping the views on this
subject expressed by such writers. Probably acting under similar
sentiments Ludovicus Cappellus, &#8224;1658 (quoted by Ball, 325a), calls
the author &quot;a trifler&quot; (nugator), and styles his production &quot;fabula
ineptissima.&quot;</p>

<p>Jerome, in the Prologue to his <i>Commentary on Daniel</i>, says that
Eusebius and Apollinarius replied to Porphyry's objection to these
additions that &quot;<span xml:lang="la">Susann&aelig; Belisque ac Draconis fabulas non contineri in
Hebraico, sed partem esse prophet&aelig; Abacuc filii Jesu <a class="pagenum" title="119" id="page119"></a>de tribu Levi;</span>&quot;
and apparently acquiesces in this statement. As there appears to be no
other authority for attributing Susanna to Habakkuk, it is a question
whether the LXX title to Bel and the Dragon was not applied to Susanna
also &quot;per incuriam.&quot; A. Scholz escapes the difficulty of Habakkuk both
here and in Bel and the Dragon by regarding it as a merely symbolic
title, which he renders by &quot;K&auml;mpfe&quot; on very slender grounds (<i>Esther und
Susanna</i>, W&uuml;rzburg, 1892, p. 138; and <i>Judith und Bel und der Drache</i>,
1896, p. 204).</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten, however, that the authorship of Daniel is of
course suggested by most of those who defend the canonicity of the book.
Origen in his Epistle to Africanus maintains the solidarity of the piece
with the book of Daniel. And it should be remembered, as a point of some
strength, that Julius Africanus' correspondence with Origen at the
beginning of century III., is the first record we have of any dispute as
to its genuineness.</p>

<p>Professor Rothstein, in Kautzsch (i. 172) gives very decidedly a
contrary opinion, stating that Susanna and Bel and the Dragon, &quot;haben
mit dem Danielbuche nur insofern zu thun, als in ihnen Daniel eine Rolle
spielt.&quot; But it is hard to offer <a class="pagenum" title="120" id="page120"></a>conclusive proof that Susanna and Bel
and the Dragon differ greatly in character from the independent
historical &quot;scenes&quot; of which the first six chapters of Daniel consist;
each, in nearly all respects, being intelligible when standing alone. It
is hard also to shew that their incorporation, and constant acceptance,
with the LXX was a deplorable mistake. And this difficulty is enhanced
when we see that, so far as is known, all the Greek and Latin speaking
Christians before Julius Africanus, and most of them after, fell
unquestionably into what, if Rothstein and those who think with him are
right, must be deemed a grave error. But even if it could be proved that
these pieces were by the author of Daniel, the recent questions as to
who that writer may have been, still further complicate the at present
insoluble problem of the authorship of Susanna.</p>
</div>

<div id="part3_4" class="section">
<h4>For Whom And With What Object Written.</h4>

<h5>For Whom.</h5>

<p>That this story was originally prepared for the use of Jews there can be
no doubt. Probably it was designed for readers and admirers of Daniel,
who would be glad of this example of the prophet's in<a class="pagenum" title="121" id="page121"></a>sight. Certainly
it was for those who loved to dwell on the interventions of God for His
people, and especially on a recent manifestation of His particular care
for oppressed individuals. Possibly also the case of those may have been
regarded who were dissatisfied with the current methods of administering
justice and conducting trials. J.W. Etheridge (<i>Jerusalem and Tiberias</i>,
1856, p. 109) deems it to be an example of Haggadah in common with its
two companion pieces, &quot;histories coloured with fable,&quot; as he styles
them&mdash;a sort of legendary appendix to carry on the interest of readers
of the canonical text.</p>

<p>But since the Christian era this writing has been employed by Christians
far more than by Jews. Perhaps its ready acceptance by the former may
have diminished the chance of popularity amongst the Israelites of later
times. They would look upon it with more suspicion, though it was
clearly connected with the literature of their race. And obviously this
enlarged acceptance among Christians was beyond the aim of the tale's
author.</p>

<h5>With What Object Written.</h5>

<p>The holding up an example of purity, maintained under circumstances of
great distress, is the <a class="pagenum" title="122" id="page122"></a>leading object which Christians have seen in
this piece. It is probable, however, that other aims as well as this
entered into the mind of the writer.</p>

<p>A dissatisfaction with the method of conducting trials such as Susanna's
is clearly manifested. A Pharisaic, or at least an anti-Sadducean,
tendency has been observed, particularly in the latter part of the
story. Then the utility of investigating small particulars is
demonstrated, and the necessity of a rigorous punishment of false
witnesses, points on which the Pharisees insisted, according to Ball
(329b, 330a), who quotes Simon ben Shetach as saying from the
Mishnah (<i>Pirke Avoth</i>, I. 9) <span xml:lang="he">&#1488;&#1514; &#1492;&#1510;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1493;&#1497; &#1502;&#1512;&#1489;&#1492; &#1500;&#1495;&#1511;&#1493;&#1512;</span>. Bissell (p. 447)
also thinks that &quot;to reform the method of conducting legal processes&quot;
was an object of the author. And certainly the story does teach the need
for a close investigation of testimony.</p>

<p>The author shews up the unscrupulousness and injustice practised even in
the leading circles of the Jewish community; and in so doing he
manifests throughout a good knowledge of the workings of the human
heart. Marshall (in Hastings' <i>D.B.</i>) assumes &quot;that we have here an
ethical mythus&quot; <a class="pagenum" title="123" id="page123"></a>(631b).<a id="fnt33" href="#fn33"><sup>[33]</sup></a> But to imagine that the story had no
other origin than this is, to say the least, unproved, and, as many
think, unproveable.</p>

<div id="fn33" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt33">[33]</a> This may be merely an echo of Reuss, who reckons Susanna &quot;in
die
Reihe der moralischen M&auml;rchen&quot; (<i>O.T.</i> 1894, VII. 159).</p>
</div>

<p>Another object may have been to extol Daniel and his judicial acumen.
There is a resemblance in this respect to the tone of several chapters
of the Book of Daniel, <i>e.g.</i>, ii. and iv. His penetration and his
prophetic gifts as a young man are set forth. Indeed the last two verses
of the &#927;&#8189; version almost make the praise of youthful piety the moral of
the book. But this, edifying as it may be, is scarcely to be taken as
the chief object of the composition; and &#920; substitutes another
conclusion as to the gratitude of Susanna's family and the growth of
Daniel's reputation.</p>

<p>Still, apart from the question of historic value, many worthy objects
may have lain within the purview of the composer; and to shew that
righteous youths are better than unrighteous elders may very well have
been one of these. To prove that even men of riper years are not
unerring in judgment may well also, as G. Jahn (quoted by Ball in
<i>Speaker's Comm.</i> 325a) points out, have been a subsidiary aim.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="124" id="page124"></a>The kind of judicial acumen displayed strikes one, too, as being very
similar to that of the young Solomon in his judgment on the two women
(I. Kings iii.); but the story here is not an imitation of that. It is a
wholly distinct instance of the same class, a most popular one for
narration in Eastern countries.</p>

<p>Another object in writing this history (and certainly the most useful
object from a Christian point of view) is to give an example of the
maintenance of purity and right, even at the risk of losing both life
and reputation.</p>

<p>It may be questioned, however, whether the idea of depressing the
estimation of elders, or of raising that of Susanna and of Daniel, was
uppermost in the writer's mind. Almost equal prominence is given to each
of these ideas. The latter, perhaps, would throw over the piece a
somewhat less attractive character than the former. But there is that in
the cast of the composition which suggests that its object may have been
quite as much to raise disgust at the elders' crime as to raise
admiration at Susanna's purity; in fact that the whiteness of her
character was designed as a foil to make more prominent the blackness of
her oppressors. On this account Jer. <a class="pagenum" title="125" id="page125"></a>xxix. 23 might perhaps be taken as
a verse which gave his cue to the writer. But these are points on which
opinions will inevitably vary according to the impression made on
different minds by a matter so nearly balanced.</p>

<p>This, the only one of our three booklets in which women appear, presents
them in a very favourable light. Beyond the imputation suggested against
those of Israel at the beginning of v. 57, it contains nothing but what
is creditable to the female sex. The present Archbishop of Armagh's
poem, &quot;The Voyage to Babylon,&quot; thus prettily depicts Susanna's purity:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;.... garden bed of balm,<br />
In one whereof old Chelcias' daughter<br />
Went to walk down beside the water,<br />
The lily both in heart and name,<br />
Whose white leaf hath no blot of shame.&quot;</p>

<p><cite>Abp. ALEXANDER'S <i>Poems</i> (Lond. 1900).</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<div id="part3_5" class="section">
<h4>Integrity And State Of The Text.</h4>

<p>In &#920; we appear to have the story presented to us without material
interpolation; but there are omissions of some not very important
matters contained in the LXX text. A. Scholz accounts for variations by
supposing changes in the Hebrew <a class="pagenum" title="126" id="page126"></a>original between the times of the two
translations. Of &#920; he says, &quot;<span xml:lang="de">&#920; ist nichts als Uebersetzer; er setzt de
suo kein wort bei</span>&quot; (p. 142)&mdash;an exaggerated statement.</p>

<p>The true LXX version was long supposed to be lost; but a cursive MS. of
it (9th or 10th century) was found in Cardinal Chigi's library at Some,
and was first printed in 1772. From its owner's name it has received the
title of Cod. Chisianus, and is now numbered 87.</p>

<p>It is almost certain that &#920; must have had the &#927;&#8189; text before him, since
the coincidences of diction, though not so continuous as in the Song of
the Three, are still far too numerous to be accidental. Bissell (p. 443)
says of all the three pieces, &quot;&#920; simply recast the version of LXX.&quot; This
dictum, however true of the Three, must not be quite literally taken of
Susanna, as he does introduce some fresh matter, particularly at the
opening and the close. Prof. Rothstein in Kautzsch (pp. 176-7) thinks
that the two Greek versions are two independent forms of the same story,
based on some common narrative material; but when the obvious idea
presents itself that this last was an Hebraic original, he speaks with
much guardedness (p. 178), lest he should commit himself to this view.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="127" id="page127"></a>&#920;'s recension is rather more polished in language, less elaborate in
some of its details.<a id="fnt34" href="#fn34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> Fritzsche, quoted in Kautzsch (pp. 176-7), says
that &quot;he worked over the LXX text, expanded the narrative, rounded it
off, and gave it a greater air of probability.&quot; Westcott's opinion to a
similar effect, however (Smith's <i>D.B.</i> ed. 2 I. 714a), is called in
question by Professor Salmon (<i>Speaker's Comm.</i> XLVI.a), who thinks
that there is quite as much to be said for the opposite views, and this
opinion is reasonable.</p>

<div id="fn34" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt34">[34]</a> <i>See</i> J.M. Fuller in S.P.C.K. <i>Comm. Introd. to
Sus.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In the LXX text there is surely something wanting at the true beginning
at v. 5, which, as it stands, is awkwardly abrupt. Both Bissell (and
Br&uuml;ll, quoted by him, p. 457) approve of the idea that the beginning was
suppressed because of its containing damaging reflections on the elders.
Then the present opening (vv. 1-5) was borrowed from &#920;, and is marked
in both Cod. Chis. and Syro-Hex. as not part of the original work, but a
foreign exordium. Rothstein (p. 184, note) thinks that in place of the
present borrowed commencement there stood a short introductory remark on
the two judging elders. Though lacking proof, this conjecture is well
within the bounds of possibility. Yet in the <a class="pagenum" title="128" id="page128"></a>Syro-Hexaplar text the
first five verses are obelised, indicating, according to Bugati (p.
163), that they are omitted in &#920;, but present in &#927;&#8189;.</p>

<p>There are in the LXX extra clauses, which are not in &#920;, scattered
throughout the book; three verses between 14 and 15, one at the end, and
considerable enlargements of vv. 45, 52; also curious substitutions,
such as that in v. 39, where in the LXX the imaginary young man escaped
because he was disguised; in Theodotion, because he was stronger than
the Elders. These alternative reasons are of course not of necessity
incompatible.</p>

<p>The Syriac W<sub>2</sub> (=Harklensian) contains many further particulars inserted
here and there, such as the Elders' names (Amid and Abid)<a id="fnt35" href="#fn35"><sup>[35]</sup></a>, v. 5,
Daniel's age of twelve years, and some words in praise of him, v. 64.
But most of these added clauses may not unfairly be regarded as
'paddings,' put in by way of embellishment. Those in v. 41 (ninth hour),
v. 45 (twelve years of age), v. 64 (increase in favour) have a Christian
look, the last two being suggestive of a knowledge of St. Luke's Gospel
(<i>cf.</i> 'Style,' p. 140). <a class="pagenum" title="129" id="page129"></a>Also the continuation of v. 43 in Lagarde's
second Syriac version has rather a Christian air, &quot;appear for me and
send a Redeemer from before thee,&quot; etc. (Hastings' <i>D.B.</i> art. <i>Sus.</i> p.
631b).</p>

<div id="fn35" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt35">[35]</a> These names, however, do not agree with the Jewish identification
of them, as the Ahab and Zedekiah of Jer. xxix. 21, which Origen reports
in his <i>Ep. ad Afric.</i> (<i>Speaker's Comm.</i> 325b).</p>
</div>

<p>An attempt has been made to account for the numerous, but not generally
very important, variations in different texts and versions by supposing
the story to have been a favourite oral narrative, long continuing in a
fluid state. This is far from improbable.</p>

<p>The Vulgate, which follows &#920; closely, appends the first verse of Bel and
the Dragon as the conclusion of this story. If this was done in order to
avoid chronological difficulty there, it was at the expense of
introducing it here, and that, to all appearance, very meaninglessly.</p>

<p>The chief uncial MS. authorities for &#920;'s text are A,B,Q, and from v. 51
onward, &#915;. A often agrees with Q, as in vv. 19, 24, and elsewhere, in
substituting <span xml:lang="el">&#960;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#946;&#973;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#953;</span> (&#927;&#8189;'s word) for <span xml:lang="el">&#960;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#946;&#8166;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>; in vv. 10, 11, etc.,
in substituting <span xml:lang="el">&#7936;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#941;&#955;&#955;&#969;</span> for <span xml:lang="el">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#941;&#955;&#955;&#969;</span>; and in v. 46, <span xml:lang="el">&#954;&#945;&#952;&#945;&#961;&#972;&#962;</span> for
<span xml:lang="el">&#7936;&#952;&#8183;&#959;&#962;</span>. In the canonical part of Daniel the substitution of <span xml:lang="el">&#7936;&#960;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#941;&#955;&#955;&#969;</span> for
<span xml:lang="el">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#941;&#955;&#955;&#969;</span> mostly holds good also so far as A is concerned (ii. 9,
16).<a id="fnt36" href="#fn36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> In v. 36, A has a <a class="pagenum" title="130" id="page130"></a>transposition of a clause, and in v. 39
another of its changes of prepositions in composition, not easily
accounted for. Q (alone) has such changes in vv. 4, 32, 38. The above
are all changes from B. &#915; often agrees with A and Q, or both, but has
nothing of importance independently.</p>

<div id="fn36" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt36">[36]</a> So in N.T., St. Mark v. 19.</p>
</div>

<p>The genitive <span xml:lang="el">&#931;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#957;&#940;&#962;</span> (instead of <span xml:lang="el">&#951;&#962;</span>) occurs occasionally in all the
above MSS. (vv. 27, 28, 62; also in LXX, v. 30). <i>cf.</i> <span xml:lang="el">&#924;&#940;&#961;&#952;&#945;&#962;</span> in St.
John xi. I.</p>

<p>Two cursive MSS. (234 Moscow, S. Synod; 235 Rome, Vat.) consist of
Susanna only; but whether they are perfect, or only fragments, is not
clear. Holmes and Parsons give no particulars. On the whole, the text of
either version is fairly trustworthy, the average of variations being
not at all above that in the canonical Daniel.</p>
</div>

<div id="part3_6" class="section">
<h4>Language And Style.</h4>

<h5>Language.</h5>

<p>As with the Three, so here, the question at once arises, Is the Greek of
the LXX more probably the original language or a translation? The
acceptance of a Semitic original seems on the whole to be more in the
ascendant than formerly; but still, the greater part of those who have
expressed an opinion <a class="pagenum" title="131" id="page131"></a>on the subject incline to Greek as the language
chosen by the author.</p>

<p>The Hebraic style is somewhat less strongly marked than in the other two
fragments, nor has an Aramaic text of this one yet been discovered.
Still, the Greek can be rendered into Hebrew rather more easily than
most Hellenistic Greek. The Greek of the &quot;rest of&quot; Esther differs much
more in style and tone from that of the canonical book to which it is
attached than does the Greek of Susanna from that of the canonical
Daniel; and, so far as this fact goes, it points to a closer linguistic
connection in this case than in the other (<i>see</i> Streane, <i>Age of Macc.</i>
p. 160; Bissell, p. 203). Delitzsch (<i>op. cit.</i> pp. 31, 101) says that
&quot;<span xml:lang="la">particul&aelig; qu&aelig;dam citantur a Nachmanide</span>&quot; (entitled <span xml:lang="he">&#1502;&#1490;&#1500;&#1514; &#1513;&#1513;&#1503;</span>) as well as
of Wisdom. The citations of the latter book are discredited by Farrar
(<i>Speaker's Comm.</i> p. 411) however, and probably those of the former are
in a similar position.</p>

<p>The early place of verbs in the sentences is here also, as in the other
pieces, to some extent noticeable as conforming to the theory of a
Semitic original. If the etymology of the name <span xml:lang="he">&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500;</span> is supposed to be
drawn from his 'judgments' in this story, such an original is probably
involved in the <a class="pagenum" title="132" id="page132"></a>supposition (<i>cf.</i> 'Title,' p. 104). The Hexaplaric
marks mentioned by Bugati (<i>op. cit.</i> 156), as occurring at the
beginning of Cod. Chisianus (&#913;, &#931;, &#920;), are strongly suggestive of
translation (<i>cf.</i> Song, 'Language,' p. 49).</p>

<p>The controversy which was started by Africanus with Origen (and resumed
by Porphyry<a id="fnt37" href="#fn37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> with Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea, and by Rufinus with Jerome) as
to the famous play upon the names of the trees (vv. 54-60) is still
unsettled. Some see in the paronomasi&aelig; conclusive proof of the
originality of the Greek; others still contend with Origen that they are
no certain evidence as to determination of language. But few will think
the analogous case which he (Origen) gives from Gen. ii. 23 a very
convincing one (<i>D.C.B.</i> art. <i>Heb. Learning</i>, p. 858b). Still we must
remember that the Hebrew language was fond of paronomasi&aelig;, and that
Daniel employs the figure in the canonical book (v. 25-28). In other
O.T. instances of its use it is, however, difficult to to see that the
LXX made any attempt to reproduce the word-play, <i>e.g.</i> Isai. v. 7, Mic.
i. 10; nor does either Greek version in Dan. v. 25-28.<a id="fnt38" href="#fn38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> But <a class="pagenum" title="133" id="page133"></a><span xml:lang="el">&#7940;&#957;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>
and <span xml:lang="el">&#7940;&#966;&#949;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span> in I. Esd. iv. 62 looks like a word-play in what may not be
original Greek; though a Semitic original of that section of I. Esd.
(iii. 1 to v. 6) is by no means proved.</p>

<div id="fn37" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt37">[37]</a> <i>Adv. Christ.</i>, Bk. XII.</p>
</div>

<div id="fn38" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt38">[38]</a> For similar instances of word-play see accounts of Melito's
pseudo-Clavis, <i>D.C.B.</i> iii. 897b, and Muratorian Fragment, line 67.</p>
</div>

<p>It has been shewn, however, in the case before us, how an adequate play
might be produced in Aramaic, as also in English (Hastings' <i>D.B.</i> art.
<i>Sus.</i>). A. Scholz, too, in his Commentary attempts this, with only
moderate success, in Hebrew<a id="fnt39" href="#fn39"><sup>[39]</sup></a>; and Delitzsch (<i>op. cit.</i> 102) gives
some Aramaic possibilities of it from Plessner. As the precise
punishments named were not carried out, this passage in the original,
whatever it may have been, was clearly constructed with a view to
introduce their names.</p>

<div id="fn39" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt39">[39]</a> Jerome in his <i>Prol. gal.</i> shews how it might be done in
Latin; and
in the Vulgate some attempt is made to reproduce it in vv. 54, 55
('schinus, scindit'). Luther tried after rhymes in German, 'Linden,'
'finden,' 'Eiche,' 'zeichnen.' In the French version of Martin no play
is attempted; but in the Arabic, according to Delitzsch (<i>op. cit.</i>
102), an easy one is produced.</p>
</div>

<p>It is interesting to compare and contrast the account of the Woman taken
in Adultery (St. John viii.) with that of Susanna, the one truly, the
other falsely, accused. There are, as might be expected, some verbal
parallels, but not sufficient to prove that the N.T. writer was
influenced by the History of Susanna, nor to give us material assistance
in deciding its <a class="pagenum" title="134" id="page134"></a>original language (<i>cf.</i> III. 'Language,' p. 49).
Notwithstanding the general inclination towards Greek, this must at
present be left in doubt, and a verdict of 'non liquet' given.</p>

<p>In the following observations on specific points in the language,
instances telling in both directions have been included:</p>

<p>v. 3 &#927;&#8189;, &#920;. The use of <span xml:lang="el">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#940;</span> after <span xml:lang="el">&#948;&#953;&#948;&#940;&#963;&#954;&#969;</span>, instead of a double
accusative, suggests a translation of <span xml:lang="he">&#1500;&#1502;&#1491;</span> followed by a <span xml:lang="el">&#1489;</span> or <span xml:lang="he">&#1502;&#1503;</span>, with
either of which it is sometimes constructed.</p>

<p>v. 5 &#927;&#8189;, &#920;. If Aramaic be the original language, <span xml:lang="el">&#7952;&#948;&#972;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#957;</span> may well
represent <span xml:lang="he">&#1510;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1488;</span>, as in IV. 14, V. 23 and elsewhere.</p>

<p>v. 6 &#927;&#8189;, &#920;. Scholz deems <span xml:lang="el">&#954;&#961;&#943;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962;</span> and <span xml:lang="el">&#954;&#961;&#953;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span> to be based on a
confusion between <span xml:lang="he">&#1502;&#1513;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;</span> and <span xml:lang="he">&#1504;&#1513;&#1508;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501;</span>.</p>

<p>vv. 7, 15, 19, 28 &#920;. <span xml:lang="el">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7952;&#947;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#964;&#959;</span> is suggestive of <span xml:lang="he">&#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;</span>.</p>

<p>vv. 8, 14, 56 &#927;&#8189;, &#920;. The use of <span xml:lang="el">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#952;&#965;&#956;&#943;&#945;</span> in a bad sense, and of <span xml:lang="el">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#952;&#965;&#956;&#941;&#969;</span>
in a perfectly innocent one in v. 15 &#920;, seems careless, and may point to
translation from an original, where different roots were used, <i>e.g.</i>
<span xml:lang="he">&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;,&#1495;&#1502;&#1491;,&#1488;&#1493;&#1492;</span>. <i>Cf.</i> LXX of Deut. v. 21 (18) for a rendering of two

<p>vv. 11, 30, 39, 63 &#920;. An instance similar to that given above (vv. 8,

<p><a class="pagenum" title="136" id="page136"></a>v. 23 &#927;&#8189;, &#920;. On the other hand, the participial clause in this verse in

&#947;&#957;&#974;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span> in v. 42 &#920;, which is not very like a translation from the

revealing mysteries to others, the former as knowing secrets Himself.</p>

<p>v. 26 &#920;. Scholz' idea that <span xml:lang="el">&#960;&#955;&#945;&#947;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span> = <span xml:lang="he">&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;</span> (as in Lev. xxvi. 21, etc.)
would suit either Aramaic or Hebrew.</p>

<p>v. 27 &#920;. Adduced as Hebraism in Winer's <i>G.T. Grammar</i> (<i>E.T.</i> 1870, p.
214); apparently, but not very clearly, on the strength of the phrase
<span xml:lang="el">&#960;&#974;&#960;&#959;&#964;&#949; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7952;&#961;&#961;&#941;&#952;&#951;</span>.</p>

often.</p>

<p>v. 53 &#927;&#8189;, &#920;. The quotation is exact in both versions from the LXX of
Lev. xxiii. 7. This fact may be thought to tell slightly in favour of a
Greek original. In the canonical Dan. ix. 13 there is a reference,
without precise quotation, to Moses' law, <a class="pagenum" title="137" id="page137"></a>so that this mention is not
out of character. The phraseology of the verse in &#920; has a distinctly
Hebraistic look, much more so than in &#927;&#8189;.</p>

<p>v. 55 &#927;&#8189;, &#920;. <span xml:lang="el">&#968;&#965;&#967;&#942;&#957;, &#954;&#949;&#966;&#945;&#955;&#942;&#957;</span> = <span xml:lang="he">&#1504;&#1462;&#1508;&#1462;&#1513;&#1473;</span> Isai. xliii. 4.</p>

<p>v. 56 &#927;&#8189;. The epithet <span xml:lang="el">&#956;&#953;&#954;&#961;&#940;</span>, as applied to the <span xml:lang="el">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#952;&#965;&#956;&#942;&#945;</span> of the Elder, is
inappropriate, and suggests an error of translation. Now <span xml:lang="he">&#1496;&#1501;&#1488;&#1492;</span> is
rendered by <span xml:lang="el">&#956;&#953;&#954;&#961;&#940;</span> in Josh. xxii. 19<a id="fnt40" href="#fn40"><sup>[40]</sup></a>, and this word would yield a
very good sense in a Semitic original here, supposed to lie in the
background.</p>

reading is absent.</p>
</div>

<p>v. 57 &#927;&#8189;, &#920;. If an animus against Israel, as Judah's inferior, is really
shewn here it would point to a Babylonian, and therefore Semitic,
original, inasmuch as the enmity between Israel and Judah does not
appear to have been so strong at Alexandria. The use of 'Israel,'
however, in v. 48 seems to include all in the first instance, and to be
employed of Susanna specially in the second, who was presumably of
Judah. The Syro-Hexaplar omits what was most likely deemed an invidious
reflection. The reference to Hos. iv. 15 in the <i>Speaker's Comm.</i> (note)
does not seem apposite as to its mention of Israel and Judah in the LXX;
only in the Hebrew.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="138" id="page138"></a>The phrase <span xml:lang="el">&#964;&#8052;&#957; &#957;&#972;&#963;&#959;&#957; &#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span> comes in strangely, as &#920;, by omitting it,
apparently thought. It is suggestive of a translation, perhaps of <span xml:lang="he">&#1495;&#1459;&#1500;&#1460;&#1497;</span>,
which seems to be used of moral disease in Hos. v. 13, and is there
rendered by <span xml:lang="el">&#957;&#972;&#963;&#959;&#962;</span>.</p>

<p>v. 59 &#927;&#8189;, &#920;. Why <span xml:lang="el">&#8017;&#956;&#8118;&#962;</span>? In LXX it comes in very awkwardly, where &#963;&#949; would
naturally be expected.</p>

<p>Scholz, not improbably, suggests that <span xml:lang="el">&#956;&#941;&#957;&#949;&#953;</span> (&#920;) and <span xml:lang="el">&#7957;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#954;&#949;&#957;</span> (&#927;&#8189;) have
been caused by reading <span xml:lang="he">&#1511;&#1493;&#1492;</span> and <span xml:lang="he">&#1511;&#1493;&#1501;</span> respectively, renderings which are
actually found of those words elsewhere in the LXX, <i>e.g.</i> Isai. v. 2
and Dan. ii. 31. That confusion sometimes occurred between <span xml:lang="el">&#1492;</span> and the
final <span xml:lang="el">&#1501;</span> is known.</p>

<p>v. 61 &#920;. <span xml:lang="el">&#932;&#8183;&#960;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#943;&#959;&#957;</span>, though referring to Susanna, may be a translation of
<span xml:lang="he">&#1512;&#1461;&#1510;&#1463;</span>, a word apparently regarded by Gesenius as epicene; so in Gen.
xxiii. 3, 4, 8 <span xml:lang="el">&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#957;&#949;&#954;&#961;&#972;&#957;</span> is the rendering of <span xml:lang="el">&#1502;&#1461;&#1514;</span>, meaning Sarah's
corpse, &quot;<span xml:lang="la">sine sexus discrimine</span>&quot; (Ges.). But <span xml:lang="el">&#960;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#943;&#959;&#957;</span> may be used here of
'neighbour' collectively without exclusive reference to Susanna.</p>

<p>v. 62 &#927;&#8189;. <span xml:lang="el">&#934;&#940;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#958;</span>, a frequent translation of <span xml:lang="he">&#1490;&#1463;&#1468;&#1497;&#1456;&#1488;</span> or <span xml:lang="he">&#1504;&#1463;&#1495;&#1463;&#1500;</span>. As it does
not appear that there are any natural ravines in Babylon, this might
refer to a deep moat outside the wall.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="139" id="page139"></a>v. 64 (62) &#927;&#8189;. Scholz says, &quot;<span xml:lang="de"><span xml:lang="he">&#917;&#7984;&#962;</span> ist sclavische Uebersetzung von <span xml:lang="he">&#1500;</span> das
der Hervorhebung des Objektes dienen soll.</span>&quot; This is probable, though
'<span xml:lang="de">sclavische</span>' seems an unnecessary epithet.</p>

<h5>Style.</h5>

<p>The style is that of a clearly-told narrative, with little of a strained
or rhetorical character about it; indeed there is less of this than in
much of the canonical Daniel. Ideas are well expressed and the story
well proportioned. There is nothing superfluous; everything bears on the
main theme. Nor is it unnatural that Daniel is made to use a play on
words out of the Elders' own mouths in order to render his sentence of
condemnation more strikingly emphatic.</p>

<p>There is high literary skill in the simple yet effective way of
narration. The story is a practical example of the saying, &quot;<span xml:lang="la">Ars est
celare artem</span>,&quot; a fact which will be best appreciated by any who will try
to tell the tale as well in their own words.<a id="fnt41" href="#fn41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> Holtzmann calls it,
&quot;<span xml:lang="de">besonders von der Kunst vielfach gefeierte Novelle</span>&quot; (Schenkel's <i>Bibel

<p><a class="pagenum" title="140" id="page140"></a>The lack of spontaneity and original freshness sometimes charged<a id="fnt42a" href="#fn42"><sup>[42]</sup></a>
against the apocryphal books is by no means conspicuous here, nor,
though perhaps less decisively, in the next addition, Bel and the
Dragon. The exciting interview between Daniel and the Elders is so drawn
as to arouse much interest. By the first incident the whole current of
Susanna's life is abruptly changed, and her destiny is made to hang in
the balance for some time in a natural, but very effective, manner. The
writer has a deep knowledge of the principles and actions of human
feeling, and a thorough grasp of the art, by no means so easy as it
looks, of telling a short story in a very engaging style. Plot,
surprise, struggle, unfolding of character, and much else which is
regarded as contributing to excellence in such a composition, we find
here.</p>

<p>In the so-called Harklensian (W<sub>2</sub> of Salmon = Churton's Syr.<a id="fnt42b" href="#fn42"><sup>[42]</sup></a>) various
details are added, such as the judgment chair brought out, which Daniel
refuses, standing up to judge; Susanna's chains (27, 50); her tears (33,
42); and her condemnation to death at the ninth hour (41). These are
obviously <a class="pagenum" title="141" id="page141"></a>designed to heighten, by the introduction of more detailed
particulars, the effect of the narrative. The tale is so interesting and
so true to nature that its popularity is easily explained. That it
became a favourite story, in an age not given to prudery, for reading
and for oral repetition, is not surprising. Like all such, it was
subject to changes of form and gradual accretions. Oral repetition, as
well as non-canonicity amongst the Jews will, to a considerable extent,
account for the divergences between the LXX and Theodotion's recensions.
The latter, in Reuss' opinion (VI. 412), &quot;<span xml:lang="de">ist reicher an Einzelnheiten
und auch besser stilisiert.</span>&quot; With this view, in the main, most will feel
themselves in accord.</p>

<h4>Religious And Social State.</h4>

<h5>Religious.</h5>

<p>An unexceptionable O.T. moral standard on the part of the writer is
maintained throughout, so that no 'difficulties' arise on this score.
There is not a suggestion of any worship beside that of the Lord; no
idolatry is even hinted at. The Captivity had done its work in that
respect. Nor is there any symptom of the later developments of
rabbinism; <a class="pagenum" title="142" id="page142"></a>not even in their inception.<a id="fnt43" href="#fn43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> It requires a very sharp
eye to find here so much as the germs of error in faith.</p>

<div id="fn43" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt43">[43]</a> Curiously enough the canonical Daniel has not escaped this
accusation, for G. Jahn (Leips. 1904, p. 64) says of vi. 28, &quot;<span xml:lang="de">Der K&ouml;nig
wie ein j&uuml;dischen Rabbiner predigt</span>.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>The Law of Moses is acted upon; taught by parents to children (v. 3);
regarded as the great authority (v. 62). The institution of Elders is in
full force, as contemplated in Jer. xix. 1 and xxvi. 17. I. Kings xx. 7
and xxi. 8, 11 shew that this body had been continued among the
separated tribes, and so naturally carried with them to their new home.
The appearance of corruption among officials in high places, who ought
to have been most free from it, is quite in accord with the religious
history of mankind in general, and of Israel in particular. Such
references as the above to Jeremiah, and that in v. 5 to Jer. xxix. 23,
are paralleled by a reference in the canonical Dan. ix. 2 to Jer. xxxv.
12.</p>

<p>When Daniel's plan was efficacious for revealing the Elders' guilt, the
just decision was approved; the right is thoroughly commended and the
wrong condemned. The heart of the people rings sound; their instincts at
the trials are in favour of justice. Morality is supported by popular
sympathy, which <a class="pagenum" title="143" id="page143"></a>has been purified and elevated by the discipline of
exile.</p>

<p>In v. 57 some prejudice is suggested as existing in the writer's mind
against the women of Israel as being less chaste than those of Judah.
Possibly he was of the latter tribe himself (<i>see</i> 'Language' on v. 57,
p. 137). The reproach to the second Elder of Canaanitish descent is in
keeping with Ezek. xvi. 3, where it is hurled against Jerusalem and her
abominations.</p>

<p>It is objected in Hastings' <i>D.B.</i> (IV. 631b) that &quot;Daniel loudly
condemns both culprits before he adduces any proof of their guilt.&quot; But
surely this was justified by the prophetic office and the spirit within
him, which endowed him with an abnormal insight into the true state of
affairs. Personally he was assured, from the outset, of their guilt, but
secured public proof to satisfy the people. This objection is rather
poor ground on which to assail the historic character of the piece. In
fine, a religious tone, befitting the time intended, is consistently
maintained throughout.</p>

<h5>Social.</h5>

<p>Incidentally a pleasing picture of home life is outlined, before the
Elders tried to corrupt it.</p>

<p>Some of the Jews were apparently living in wealth <a class="pagenum" title="144" id="page144"></a>and comfort during
the Captivity; but the end of v. 4 shews that Joacim's estate was
pre-eminent, not a sample of the general condition of the exiles. If not
royal (as Jul. Afric. in his letter to Origen hints, and Origen doubts
in his reply, &sect; 14), it was evidently of an upper class; and a kind of
tribunal was held at his house. The state of life here depicted agrees
with Jeremiah's advice in xxix. 5; and with II. Esd. iii. 2, if that
too could be applied to the captives.</p>

<p>The King of Babylon was content with the subjugation and deportation of
the Jews, allowing them considerable liberty when he got them into
Babylonia. In this connection Ps. cv. 46 naturally occurs to the mind.
The captives evidently had alleviations granted them in Babylon by their
conquerors, witness Evil-Merodach's kindness to Jehoiachin, II. Kings
xxv. 28. There is, however, no indication even of the beginnings of that
trade and commerce which was so characteristic of much of the dispersion
in later years.</p>

<p>Great freedom to regulate their own affairs is shewn, including, to all
appearance, the power of inflicting the death-penalty, v. 62. This last
power has been objected to as unhistoric. But J.J. Blunt<a id="fnt44" href="#fn44"><sup>[44]</sup></a>
<a class="pagenum" title="145" id="page145"></a>illustrates the possibility of this, by citing Origen's letter to
Africanus to shew that the Jews under the Romans enjoyed a similar power
in his day. Origen defends the correctness of v. 62 by adducing this as
a similar instance in his own knowledge. Blunt treats the matter as a
kind of &quot;undesigned coincidence,&quot; rendering credible the death penalties
spoken of in Acts ix. 1, xxii. 4, xxiv. 6.<a id="fnt45" href="#fn45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> So Edersheim (<i>D.C.B.</i>
art. <i>Philo</i>, p. 365b), &quot;The rule of the Jewish community in
Alexandria had been committed by Augustus to a council of Elders.&quot; This
is also stated in the Jewish Encyclop&aelig;dia (New York and Lond.,
<i>Alexandria</i> I., 362a): &quot;Philo distinctly states that at the time of
Augustus the 'gerusia' assumed the position of the 'genarch.' This is
the word he uses for 'ethnarch,' <i>Contra Flaccum</i>, &sect; 10. Origen to
Africanus, &sect; 14, writes of this privilege as having been granted by
'C&aelig;sar' without specifying which C&aelig;sar, and though he does not name
Alexandria, his words <span xml:lang="el">&#7988;&#963;&#956;&#949;&#957; &#959;&#7985; &#960;&#949;&#960;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953;</span> probably imply that place.&quot;
These references do not of course prove that the Jews in Babylonia had
the like privileges, but they shew, as Origen saw, a parallel case.
Perhaps those who are in favour of the Alexandrian origin of <a class="pagenum" title="146" id="page146"></a>Susanna
might use this to shew that the writer had transferred to Babylonia the
circumstances of his own day; but his own day would almost certainly be
before the time of Augustus.</p>

<p>There is no mention of any government except the Jews' internal
administration; but then the native population of Babylon (unless
perchance it be in the shape of the servants) does not enter into the
story. The legal working at Babylon of this little &quot;<span xml:lang="la">imperium in imperio</span>&quot;
had plainly an unsatisfactory side, although Susanna's rights were
vindicated by another power against injustice and oppression. Still, it
may not be fair to condemn the whole system on the strength of this
single instance.</p>

<p>The main drift of the tale indicates the existence of much
corruption<a id="fnt46" href="#fn46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> in the presbytery; yet the heart of the exiled people in
general had a healthy tone; witness the sorrowful sympathy with Susanna
(v. 33), and the delight at justice being ultimately done (vv. 60, 63).</p>

<div id="fn46" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt46">[46]</a> Quintus Curtius (v. 1) gives a terrible account, in connection
with
Alexander's capture of this city, of Babylonian debauchery, which must
have been of long standing when it had attained the pitch he indicates.</p>
</div>

<p>The Elders grossly abused Joacim's hospitality. Seemingly they had
plenty of time to waste, and <a class="pagenum" title="147" id="page147"></a>worse. It is noteworthy that two 'judges'
were chosen, annually, it would seem, from the 'elders of the people.'
This last phrase occurs in Numb. xi. 16, and is frequent in the N.T.,
but not with <span xml:lang="el">&#7952;&#954;</span> as here.</p>

<p>The modest veiling of Susanna in <i>v. 32</i>, more distinctly expressed (<span xml:lang="el">&#7968;&#957;
&#947;&#8048;&#961; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#965;&#956;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;</span>) in &#920; than in &#927;&#8189;, reminds one of Rebekah's veiling in
Gen. xxiv. 65, and is quite in accordance with the custom of the
country. So are the &quot;oil and washing balls&quot; of <i>v. 17</i> (A.V. and R.V.);
this last term is peculiar, and is used apparently for soap.<a id="fnt47" href="#fn47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> It is
so employed in Gerard's <i>Herbal</i>, ed. 1633, p. 1526, where he says, &quot;of
this gum [storax] there are made sundry excellent perfumes... and sweet
washing balls.&quot; The 'sawing' or 'cutting asunder' of <i>v. 35</i> was a
Babylonian punishment, as is shewn in ii. 5 and iii. 29 of the canonical
book.</p>

<div id="fn47" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt47">[47]</a> &quot;Soap making is the chief industry of modern Palestine&quot;

</div>

<p>The death penalty for adultery (<i>vv. 43, 45</i>) is in agreement with Lev.
xx. 10, Deut. xxii. 22, and Ezek. xvi. 38, though not with the laxity of
later times (<i>see</i> art. <i>Adultery</i>, Smith's <i>D.B.</i>; <i>Marriage</i>,
Hastings' <i>D.B.</i>). The Syriac W<sub>2</sub> interpolation after <i>v. 41</i> seems to
regard precipitation as equivalent to <a class="pagenum" title="148" id="page148"></a>stoning. In the &#927;&#8189; of v. 62 both
this punishment and that of fire are meted out to the Elders as
retributive justice. Reuss' note on the trial is amusing, &quot;die Richter
sich als Dummk&ouml;pfe erwissen und Susanna vollst&auml;ndig den ihrigen verloren
hatte.&quot;</p>

<p>But we are disposed on the whole to agree with J.M. Fuller (S.P.C.K.
<i>Comm., Introd. to Sus.</i>) when he writes, &quot;The facts underlying the
story are in themselves probable,&quot; rather more than with Churton (p.
392), who deems the narrative to be &quot;probably apocryphal, without strict
regard to historical facts.&quot;</p>

<h4>Theology.</h4>

<p>This 'History' does not appear to have been written with a view of
supporting any erroneous or debateable points in theology.</p>

<p>God is represented as being in heaven, as One on whom the heart relies
(v. 35); as eternal, a knower of secrets, of entire foreknowledge (v.
42); One to be appealed to by His servants in danger (v. 43),
efficaciously answering humble requests. The value of ejaculatory prayer
to Him in sudden peril is shewn (v. 44).</p>

<p>God had not so entirely cast off His people as to cease from caring for
separate souls. He hears <a class="pagenum" title="149" id="page149"></a>the prayers of individuals (v. 35, end, &#927;&#8189;),
for the individual, as well as the nation, is under His eye. He is
spoken of as raising up &quot;the holy spirit&quot; of a man (v. 45); as
conferring the eldership, regarded as a divine institution (v. 50); as
forbidding injustice (v. 53); as giving sentence to an angel to
execute upon an individual (v. 55); as worthy to be praised for saving
those who hope in Him (v. 61). A special Providence is recognised as
watching over the destinies of separate souls; inspiring Daniel for a
special effort; rescuing Susanna from a special danger. Heaven is
regarded as the seat of the Divine Judge, towards which the innocent
Susanna turned her eyes (v. 35), but from which the guilty Elders
averted theirs (v. 9).</p>

<p>In v. 5 God is termed <span xml:lang="el">&#8001; &#948;&#949;&#963;&#960;&#972;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span> (<i>cf.</i> St. Luke ii. 29, Acts iv. 24);
in vv. 24, 44, <span xml:lang="el">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span> in vv. 55, 59 (&#920;) <span xml:lang="el">&#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</span>, for which &#927;&#8189; has
<span xml:lang="el">&#954;&#973;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>, a word which it seems to prefer, as in i. 17, ii. 45, ix. 18.
The fear of the Lord is evidently approved (v. 2), and instruction in
the Law of Moses regarded as proper (v. 3), which is also referred to
in vv. 33 and 62 (&#920; only), and in act in v. 34. It would appear
likely too that II. Sam. xxiv. 14 is quoted in v. 22 (&#920;), Susanna in
her strait borrowing the exclamation of David in his, <a class="pagenum" title="150" id="page150"></a>and the words of
both may well be contrasted with the idea of Hos. iv. 16b. Adultery is
condemned as &quot;sin before the Lord&quot; (v. 23).</p>

<p>An angel is spoken of in vv. 44, 45 (&#927;&#8189; only) as giving a spirit of
understanding to Daniel. The former verse might be taken to mean that he
was visible.<a id="fnt48" href="#fn48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> He enabled Daniel to clear Susanna from her false
accusation. An angel is also named in v. 55, in both versions, as likely
to execute God's vengeance on the lying Elders. He is also mentioned in
v. 62 of &#927;&#8189; as bringing a judgment of fire. This frequent mention of
angels is quite in keeping with the canonical Daniel and other late
books. And as E. Bunsen remarks, &quot;the apocryphal doctrine about angels
and evil spirits is sanctioned by the recorded doctrine of Christ&quot;
(<i>Hidden Wisd. of Christ</i>, 1865, I. 186). But it is singular that what
has generally been considered the later recension should have less of it
in this case than the earlier.</p>

<div id="fn48" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt48">[48]</a> <span xml:lang="el">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#7984;&#948;&#959;&#948;

</div>

<p>The description (v. 9) of the workings of conscience, while overt sin
was under consideration, but before it was actually committed, shews a
deep knowledge of the human heart, such as is found in the biblical
writers. A process the reverse of 'turn<a class="pagenum" title="151" id="page151"></a>ing unto God,' 'having the eyes
unto Him' (II. Chron. xx. 12, Ps. xxv. 14), is very accurately depicted,
as the dwelling upon some attractive lust is allowed to engage the mind.
A better way of narrating such a matter it would be hard to devise.</p>

<p>Hippolytus, in his <i>Comm. on Dan.</i>, treats the whole story as having an
allegoric meaning. Joacim represents Christ, Susanna the Christian
Church; the bath represents Holy Baptism; and the two Elders the Jews
and Gentiles persecuting the faithful (<i>D.C.B.</i> art. <i>Hippolytus</i>, p.
104a. For Christian sarcophagi with like symbolism, <i>see</i> 'Art'). M.
de Castillo (Madrid, 1658) reflects in symbolism the increments of a
later age when he sees in Susanna a type of the Virgin Mary&mdash;&quot;<span xml:lang="la">Maria
Virgo in illa figurata.</span>&quot;</p>

<p>There does not appear to be anything 'Messianic' in this writing, unless
Daniel himself be regarded as a type of Christ, executing just judgment,
separating the righteous publicly from the wicked. There is also
Origen's statement bearing upon this matter (<i>ad Afric.</i>, see <i>Speaker's
Comm.</i> 327b), as to the prospect of becoming Messiah's mother, which
the Elders held out to Susanna. St. Jerome, at the end of his
<i>Commentary on Jeremiah</i>, <a class="pagenum" title="152" id="page152"></a>has a slightly different version of their
outrageous pretences.</p>

<p>Standing on surer ground than such speculations the theology of the
piece itself is sound and proper.</p>
</div>

<div id="part3_9" class="section">
<h4>Chronology.</h4>

<p>The period in which this trial befel Susanna is plainly that of the
Babylonian Captivity, after the Jews were well settled in their
conqueror's land, but not very long after.</p>

<p>The time covered by the narrative itself is obviously a very short one,
probably only a few days at the outside.</p>

<p>If the suggestion in Julius Africanus' letter to Origen is correct,
Joacim, Susanna's husband, was none other than Jehoiachin, the captive
king of Judah. But Africanus is not by any means confident of this; nor
does Hippolytus so identify them,<a id="fnt49" href="#fn49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> but contents himself with
commenting on the statement of the text (v. 4) that Joacim was a very
rich man. Nor is there anything in the Greek of either version to
indicate his royalty, though the assertion <a class="pagenum" title="153" id="page153"></a>that &quot;he was more honourable
than all others&quot; fits in well with the notion. But if the story was
co&euml;val in its first form with the events narrated in it, the fact might
be taken as universally known; or it might be thought politic to
suppress it, as likely to be unpalatable to the reigning Babylonian
monarch, in the written record. Thus it is possible to answer to a great
extent Bissell's objection on v. 7, &quot;that there seems to be no good
reason why it should not have been definitely stated.&quot;</p>

<div id="fn49" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt49">[49]</a> In Hastings' <i>D.B.</i> art. <i>Jehoiachin</i>, it is stated
that he does;
but Hippolytus' <i>Comm.</i> in Migne, <i>Patr. gr.</i> x. 689, does not shew
this. It is apparently based on a quotation from Hippolytus by Georgius
Syncellus, given among the critical notes of Bonwetsch's ed. of <i>Hipp.</i>
p. 10 (Lips. 1897).</p>
</div>

<p>His name is given as <span xml:lang="el">&#7992;&#969;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;</span> both here, in II. Kings xxiv. 8, 12, and in
I. Esd. i. 43, exactly the same as that of his father and predecessor
Jehoiakim in I. Esd. i. 37 (39). Elsewhere the name is transliterated
<span xml:lang="el">&#7992;&#949;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span> and <span xml:lang="el">&#7992;&#969;&#945;&#967;&#943;&#956;</span> (Bar. i. 3, Jer. xxii. 24, <i>var. lect.</i>, II. Chron.
xxxvi. 8, 9). In Judith iv. 6, xx. 8 we have <span xml:lang="el">&#7992;&#969;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;</span> without variation,
as the name of the high priest.</p>

<p>If this identification be correct the date must be subsequent to 597
B.C., the year of Jehoiachin's captivity; and probably not long after,
since Daniel, who was taken to Babylon in or soon after the third year
of Jehoiakim's reign in 603-4,<a id="fnt50" href="#fn50"><sup>[50]</sup></a> is represented as being still
<span xml:lang="el">&#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#957;&#949;&#969;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span> in v. 45. This <a class="pagenum" title="154" id="page154"></a>phrase is somewhat tautologically
rendered by A.V. as a 'young youth,' an instance which might be cited in
support of the view that the English of the apocryphal was less
excellent than that of the canonical books<a id="fnt51" href="#fn51"><sup>[51]</sup></a>; but, strange to say, the
awkward expression is continued in R.V.</p>

<div id="fn50" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt50">[50]</a> But see G. Jahn, <i>in loc.</i>, and art. <i>Jehoiakim</i> in
Hastings'
<i>D.B.</i> as to making the date in Dan. i. 1 a little later.</p>

</div>

<p>Without necessarily implying it, v. 2 might easily be taken to convey
the impression that Jehoiachin married in Babylon. Thus Hippolytus
asserts, <span xml:lang="el">&#7992;&#969;&#945;&#954;&#949;&#8054;&#956; &#960;&#940;&#961;&#959;&#953;&#954;&#959;&#962; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#7952;&#957; &#914;&#945;&#946;&#965;&#955;&#8182;&#957;&#953; &#955;&#945;&#956;&#946;&#940;&#957;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#931;&#969;&#963;&#940;&#957;&#957;&#945;&#957;
&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#947;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#8150;&#954;&#945;</span> (Migne, <i>Patr. gr.</i> X. 689). And, on 'the same year' of v.
5, Reuss gives the interrogative note, &quot;<span xml:lang="de">Im Jahre der Verheiratung des
Joakim?</span>&quot;</p>

<p>If Susanna's husband really be Jehoiachin, he is the Jechonias who finds
a place in the genealogy of Christ, St. Matt. i. 11, 12, Jehoiakim
(Eliakim) being omitted. Bugati (<i>Dan.</i> p. 166) argues that Joakim is
not Jehoiachin because of the name: &quot;<span xml:lang="la">quo circa erroris arguendus est
Jacobus Edessenus, sive auctor scholii ad calcem historiae Susannas
adjecti in codice Parisiensi, qui Joacem virum Susann&aelig; eum Joachin rege
confundat.</span>&quot; Bugati was probably unaware of the above-mentioned
variations in the <a class="pagenum" title="155" id="page155"></a>spelling of the name, which neutralize the force of
his argument.</p>

<p>Two other doubtful indications of time are given by Hippolytus, viz.
that Chelchias was Jeremiah's brother, making Susanna therefore his
niece (Westcott's art. <i>Chelcias</i>, Smith's <i>D.B.</i>), and that 'a fit
time' in v. 15 intimated the Feast of the Passover. Unsupported
tradition and conjecture look like the grounds of these two indications
respectively. Bardenhewer (<i>op. cit.</i> p. 75) not unreasonably deems that
Hippolytus is thinking of Christian Baptism in connection with Easter,
and so throws back the idea into the 'bath' and 'the fit time' of the
Passover.</p>

<p>The Harklensian Syriac (W<sub>2</sub>, Walton's second Syriac<a id="fnt52" href="#fn52"><sup>[52]</sup></a>) asserts both in
vv. 1 and 45 that Daniel was twelve years old at the date of the story;
also that Susanna was a widow after a married life of a few days only
(v. 5), a statement to which neither Greek version lends any
countenance. In fact, v. 63 (&#920;) supposes Joakim to be alive at the end
of the tale. Now we know from II. Kings xxv. 27 and Jer. xxviii. (xxxv.)
1-4 that Jehoiachin lived some years at least after his deportation.
These Syriac insertions therefore as to Daniel's age and Susanna's
<a class="pagenum" title="156" id="page156"></a>widowhood are hardly compatible with one another on the supposition
that she was the wife of Jehoiachin, king of Judah.</p>

<div id="fn52" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt52">[52]</a> <i>Speaker's Comm.</i>, end of <i>Introd. to Sus.</i></p>
</div>

<p>It has been pointed out in the <i>Speaker's Commentary</i>, xlvib, that the
insertion of 'twelve years old' into the text of the Syriac of Susanna
may be due to &quot;Christian re-handling,&quot; as also the extension of the
final verse about Daniel's fame, &quot;and he increased in favour with the
family of Susanna,&quot; etc., so as to produce a correspondence with St.
Luke ii. 42, 52. This is a possible theory, but one lacking, so far, the
support of evidence. The condemnation of Susanna &quot;at the ninth hour&quot; (v.
41) might likewise be attributed to the same Christian influence. This
was no doubt operative here, as it was with Hippolytus.</p>

<p>In this connection it is worthy of note that in the longer recension of
the &quot;Ignatian&quot; <i>Epist. ad Magnes.,</i> &sect; III., Daniel is spoken of as
<span xml:lang="el">&#948;&#969;&#948;&#949;&#954;&#945;&#949;&#964;&#942;&#962;</span> when he <span xml:lang="el">&#947;&#941;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#949; &#954;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#967;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8183; &#952;&#949;&#943;&#8179; &#960;&#957;&#949;&#973;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#953;</span>, a phrase evidently
reminiscent of the history of Susanna. Bishop Lightfoot notes on this:
&quot;His age is not given in the narrative, and it is difficult to see
whence it could have been derived.&quot; He dates the longer Ignatian
epistles in the second half of the <a class="pagenum" title="157" id="page157"></a>4th century (I. 246), while Thomas
of Harkel lived in the 6th and 7th centres. But, though so much later,
this Syriac translation may perhaps afford some clue to the ultimate
discovery of Ignatius', or rather his expander's, source of information.
The words <span xml:lang="el">&#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#957;&#949;&#974;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span> do not of course necessarily imply such
extreme youth as twelve years; nor are we in any way tied to the
accuracy of this or other Harklensian variations.</p>

<p>Though this Addition therefore has its chronological difficulties, they
need not be regarded as absolutely insurmountable.</p>
</div>

<div id="part3_10" class="section">
<h4>Canonicity.</h4>

<p>Before the correspondence of Origen with Julius Africanus, whose letter
is &quot;a model of sober criticism&quot; (Swete, <i>Patristic Study</i>, p. 56)&mdash;a
correspondence renewed between Eusebius of C&aelig;sarea and Porphyry<a id="fnt53" href="#fn53"><sup>[53]</sup></a>,
and between Rufinus and Jerome, with less sobriety&mdash;we have no record of
the point having been mooted. For, as Bissell writes (p. 448), &quot;We have
no evidence that these pieces were not regarded as fully on a level with
the remainder of the book.&quot; Africanus heard Origen use Susanna in
controversy <a class="pagenum" title="158" id="page158"></a>with one Bassus, and subsequently wrote to remonstrate, he
himself being resident in Palestine. Some of his objections in this
famous letter have considerable force, while others are very weak
(<i>D.C.B.</i> I. p. 54b).</p>

<div id="fn53" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt53">[53]</a> <i>See</i> Jerome's <i>Pref. to Daniel</i>, end.</p>
</div>

<p>Origen deems Susanna part of the genuine Daniel, cut out by the Jews, as
he suggests in his <i>Epistle</i> to Africanus. Bishop Gray (<i>O.T.</i> p. 612)
describes this Epistle as 'suspected'; but it appears now to be
generally accepted. Origen thinks that the motive of Susanna's exclusion
was its relation of particulars discreditable to the Jewish nation. But
the Bishop truly says, &quot;there is no foundation for this improbable
fancy.&quot; It is, however, maintained by Philippe in Vigouroux' <i>Dict.</i>
(<i>cf.</i> 'Title and Position,' p. 109).</p>

<p>Origen also asserts the canonicity of Susanna in <i>Hom. in Levit.</i> &sect; 1
(middle): &quot;<span xml:lang="la">Sed tempus est nos adversus improbos presbyteros uti sanct&aelig;
Susann&aelig; vocibus, quas illi quidem repudiantes, historiam Susann&aelig; de
catalogo divinorum voluminum desecrarunt. Nos autem et suscipimus, et
opportune contra ipsos proferimus, dicentes 'Angusti&aelig; mihi undique,'</span>&quot;
etc. (v. 22).</p>

<p>Again, Origen refers to the matter in his <i>In Matth&aelig;um Commentariorum
Series</i>. He quotes <a class="pagenum" title="159" id="page159"></a>Daniel's words in v. 55, &quot;<span xml:lang="la">angelus Domini habens
gladium scindet te medium,&quot; and also &quot;ausi sumus uti in hoc loco, Dan.
exemplo, non ignorantes quoniam in Hebr&aelig;o positum non est, sed quoniam
in ecclesiis tenetur. Alterius autem temporis est requirere de
huiusmodi</span>&quot; (Migne, <i>Patr. gr.</i> XIII. 1696). Delitzsch (<i>op. cit.</i> p.
103) says, on second thoughts, that he &quot;<span xml:lang="la">adductum esse, ut ipsos libros
apocryphos ab Origine pro <span xml:lang="el">&#947;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#943;&#959;&#953;&#962;</span> et divinis habitos esse censeam</span>.&quot;</p>

<p>About the same time, or probably a little earlier, St. Hippolytus (&#8224;230)
gives a similar reason for the extrusion of this episode. He notes on v.
8, <span xml:lang="el">&#964;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#945; &#956;&#8050;&#957; &#959;&#8016;&#957; &#959;&#7985; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#7992;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#945;&#943;&#969;&#957; &#7940;&#961;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#946;&#959;&#973;&#955;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#957;&#8166;&#957; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#953;&#954;&#972;&#960;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#957; &#964;&#8134;&#962;
&#946;&#943;&#946;&#955;&#959;&#965;, &#966;&#940;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#949;&#962; &#956;&#8052; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#941;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; &#964;&#945;&#8166;&#964;&#945; &#7952;&#957; &#914;&#945;&#946;&#965;&#955;&#8182;&#957;&#953;&#903; &#945;&#7984;&#963;&#967;&#965;&#957;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#8017;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#8182;&#957;

(<i>op. cit.</i> p. 76) remarks, &quot;<span xml:lang="de">Susanna soll also fr&uuml;her auch in dem
j&uuml;dischen Kanon gestanden haben und erst sp&auml;ter (unliebsamen Vorw&uuml;rfen
gegen&uuml;ber) aus demselben entfernt worden sein.</span>&quot;</p>

<p>A. Scholz, however, who treats the book allegorically as a 'vision,'
attributes early opinions adverse to its canonicity to the
&quot;<span xml:lang="de">Missverstehen der Erz&auml;hlung und die unl&ouml;sbaren Schwierigkeiten, die
<a class="pagenum" title="160" id="page160"></a>dieselbe bei der historischen Auffassung macht</span>&quot; (p. 139). The 'vision'
theory, however, is a difficult one to maintain, serviceable though it
may be in evading historic difficulties.</p>

<p>Lists of books of the canon do not help us much, as it is often
uncertain whether 'Daniel' covers the Additions or not. We may safely
conclude, however, that it does in Origen's own list, as preserved for
us by Eusebius (<i>H.E.</i> VI. 25).</p>

<p>In the pseudo-Athanasius' <i>Synopsis sacr. script.</i> &sect; 74, Susanna is
named, after the books he deems canonical, as <span xml:lang="el">&#7952;&#954;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#948;&#8050; &#964;&#959;&#973;&#964;&#969;&#957;</span>, along
with four books of Maccabees and the Psalms of Solomon. In this case we
might conclude that <span xml:lang="el">&#916;&#945;&#957;&#953;&#942;&#955;</span> does not cover Susanna; but in the beginning
of the <i>Synopsis of Daniel</i> (&sect; 41) the story is mentioned as part of
that book, and Bel and the Dragon, at the end, in the same way. This
author's view, then, for and against the canonicity looks somewhat
undecided. So in Cyril of Jerusalem's list in <i>Catech.</i> IV. &sect; 35,
'Daniel' pretty certainly includes Susanna and probably the other two
Additions, because in <i>Cat.</i> XVI. &sect; 31, &quot;de Spiritu sancto,&quot; he quotes
Susanna 45 in company with Dan. iv. 6 as if on an equal footing.</p>

<p>It is quoted as Scripture before Origen's time by <a class="pagenum" title="161" id="page161"></a>Iren&aelig;us IV. xxxv. 2,
xli. 1; Tert. <i>de Cor. IV.</i>; Clem. Alex. <i>Proph. Ecl.</i> 1. Methodius,

trial is instanced <span xml:lang="el">&#8033;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#948;&#973;&#959; &#960;&#961;&#949;&#963;&#946;&#965;&#964;&#941;&#961;&#959;&#965;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#8048; &#931;&#969;&#963;&#940;&#957;&#957;&#951;&#962; &#7952;&#957; &#914;&#945;&#946;&#965;&#955;&#8182;&#957;&#953;</span>,
and again in cap. 51 (Mansi, <i>Concil.</i> Florence, 1759, I. 352, 353).</p>

<p>Though Jerome (<i>Pref. to Dan.</i>) calls this and the other Additions
'fabul&aelig;' (twice), it is pointed out by Peronne in his note to Corn. &agrave;
Lap. on Dan. xiii. 1 (Paris, 1874) that Jerome uses the same word of the
story of Samson (no ref. given), which he certainly regarded as
canonical. He claims therefore that here it has &quot;<span xml:lang="la">verum et nativum sensum
vocis fabul&aelig;, qu&aelig; quidem significat 'historiam, sermonem.'</span>&quot; But even if
any disparaging sense could be eliminated from this particular word,
Jerome's opinion is otherwise expressed.</p>

<p>The only possible reference to Susanna observable, I think, in the N.T.
is in Matt, xxvii. 24, unless the name of Susanna in St. Luke viii. 3 be
<a class="pagenum" title="162" id="page162"></a>taken from our heroine's. It is of course emblematic of lily-like
purity, and therefore very suitable for a woman. The story, with some
omissions, forms the Epistle for Saturday after the third Sunday in Lent
in the Sarum and Roman Missals.</p>

<p>Luther says that this and Bel are &quot;beautiful and spiritual compositions,
just as Judith and Tobias &quot; (Bleek, <i>O.T.</i>, Venables' transl., 1869, II.
339).</p>

<p>In the Greek Church the Synods of Constantinople and Jerusalem in 1672
expressly decided, in opposition to Cyril Lucar and the Calvinists, that
Susanna and Bel (with some other apocryphal books) were genuine elements
of Divine Scripture, and denounced Cyril Lucar's conduct in styling them
Apocrypha as ignorance or wickedness (Bleek, II. 343; Loisy, <i>O.T.</i> p.
243). The present Eastern Church reckons them, with the Song of the
Three, canonical, as Bishop Nectarius expressly states (<i>Greek Manuals
of Church Doctrine</i>, publ. by Eng. Ch. Assoc., Lond., 1901, p. 19). Also
Bar-Hebr&aelig;us (&#8224;1286), the Monophysite, comments on these fragments as if
Holy Scripture (Loisy, p. 245). We see then that the testimonies to
canonicity are of considerable strength, more so than is perhaps
generally realised, even though the arguments to the contrary <a class="pagenum" title="163" id="page163"></a>may be
still stronger. The statement of Fritzsche (<i>Libri apocryphi</i>, 1871, p.
xiii) is moderate and reasonable, fitting in well as it does with the
views of our own Church, &quot;<span xml:lang="la">Liber Danielis canonicus iam eo ipso tempore,
quo primum in linguam gr&aelig;cam transferebatur, additamentis gr&aelig;cis auctus
est, quorum tria maiora fere inde a seeulo quarto in eccl. christiana
vulgo a viris doctis apocrypha iudicata sunt.</span>&quot;</p>

<h4>Early Christian Literature And Art.</h4>

<h5>Literature.</h5>

<p>NEW TESTAMENT. In St. Matt. xxvii. 24 Pilate possibly adopts Daniel's
words in v. 46, or at least accidentally falls in with them. In Heb. xi.
23 and Sus. 7 (&#927;&#8189;) there is a strong similarity in the use of the word
<span xml:lang="el">&#7936;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#962;</span>, as well as in Exod. ii. 2.</p>

<p>&quot;Among names taken from the O.T., that of Susanna is not uncommon&quot;
(<i>D.C.A.</i> art. <i>Names</i>, 1374a). Not improbably therefore Susanna, in
St. Luke viii. 3, may have been named after the Susanna of this history,
as already mentioned under 'Canonicity,' p. 161. St. Susanna of the
Roman Calendar, who is dated <i>circ.</i> 293, is most likely an example of
this. She is not given an article in <i>D.C.B.</i>, but there is a short
<a class="pagenum" title="164" id="page164"></a>notice of her in <i>D.C.A.</i>, as commemorated in various Martyrologies on
August 11th.</p>

<p>IREN&AElig;US (&#8224;200). In <i>Adv. H&aelig;r.</i>III. xlii. 1 there is an apparent
reference to v. 55; in IV, xxxv. 2 to v. 42; and in IV. xli. 1, 'de
presbyteris injustis,' vv. 20, 26 are quoted as &quot;a Daniele propheta
voces&quot; in reproof of Christian presbyters. It is probable, too, that
&quot;Deum qui absconsa manifestat&quot; (IV. xxxi. 2) may be a reminiscence of
the phrase <span xml:lang="el">&#8001; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#954;&#961;&#965;&#960;&#964;&#8182;&#957; &#947;&#957;&#974;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span> in v. 42; and still more probably
perhaps &quot;<span xml:lang="la">qui est absconsorum cognitor</span>&quot; in IV. xxxv. 2 has its origin in
this same verse.</p>

<p>CLEMENT or ALEXANDRIA (&#8224;220). In <i>Strom.</i> IV. (Heinsius' ed., Paris,
1629, p. 522) he speaks of Susanna and Miriam together, as if their
biblical positions were on a par. In Hort and Mayor's edit. (1902) of
<i>Strom.</i> VII. the words <span xml:lang="el">&#960;&#961;&#8056; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#941;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;</span> in &sect; 37 are referred to Susanna
43 (&#920;); but it is hardly safe to assume that we have here more than an
accidental approximation of wording.</p>

<p>HIPPOLYTUS (&#8224;230) distinctly recognizes Susanna at the end of his
<i>Preface to Daniel</i>, as well as in his <i>Commentary</i> itself. This last,
Bardenhewer (Freiburg im Breisgau, 1877, p. 69) deems, on account of its
homiletic phrases, to be &quot;<span xml:lang="de">Bruchst&uuml;cke einer Homilie</span>&quot; (<i>cf.</i> art.
<i>Hippolytus, D.C.B.</i> iii. 102a).</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="165" id="page165"></a>APOSTOLIC CONSTITUTIONS (third century?). Susanna's trial is instanced
in II. 49, &quot;Concerning accusers and witnesses&quot; (<i>see</i> quotation under
'Canonicity,' p. 161), and again in cap. 51.</p>

<p>TERTULLIAN (&#8224;240). In <i>de Corona militis</i>, 4, after instancing Rebecca,
he goes on to say of Susanna: &quot;<span xml:lang="la">si et Susanna in iudicio revelata
argumentum velandi pr&aelig;stat, possum dicere: et his velamen arbitrii
fuit</span>,&quot; etc. Also <i>de Pudic.</i> 17, etc.</p>

<p>ORIGEN (&#8224;254) frequently refers to Susanna in his commentaries, many
references to which are collected by Sch&uuml;rer, <i>H.J.P.</i>, II. III. 186. In
the middle of &sect; 1 of his <i>Hom.</i> I. <i>in Levitic.</i> he quotes Susanna's
words in v. 22 as if appropriate to the mouth of the book itself,
surrounded, by those who doubted its canonicity (words quoted under
'Canonicity,' p. 158). In Eusebius' Pr&aelig;p. Ev. VI. 11, Origen is given as
quoting v. 42 as a proof of God's foreknowledge, <span xml:lang="el">&#8048;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#8182;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;
&#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#8134;&#963;&#945;&#953;</span>. In his <i>Commentary</i> on St. John (bk. XX. &sect; 5) he quotes v.
56 with <span xml:lang="el">&#8033;&#962; &#8001; &#916;&#945;&#957;&#953;&#942;&#955; &#966;&#951;&#963;&#953;</span>.</p>

<p>CYPRIAN (&#8224;258), in <i>Ep.</i> XLIII. 4, illustrates his remarks by a
reference to &quot;Susannam pudicam.&quot;</p>

<p>Bleek (<i>O.T.</i> II. 316) says that Bel and the Dragon and Susanna were
used by both Iren&aelig;us and Cyprian <a class="pagenum" title="166" id="page166"></a>in a similar way to the Scriptures of
the Hebrew canon.</p>

<p>METHODIUS (&#8224;330), in his &quot;Song of the Virgins&quot; (II. 2). <span xml:lang="el">&#7948;&#957;&#969;&#952;&#949;&#957;, &#960;&#945;&#961;&#952;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953;

<p>GREGORY OF NYSSA (&#8224;396) quotes, in his <i>Hexa&euml;meron</i> (Migne, <i>Patr. gr.</i>

writing (XXIX. 1).</p>

<p>AMBROSE (&#8224;397) has, Sermons XLIX. and L., &quot;de accusato Domino apud
Pilatum et de Susanna,&quot; in which he draws a parallel between them, as to
silence under false charges, at considerable length (Basel, ed. 1527,
III. 549).</p>

<p>SULPICIUS SEVERUS (&#8224;400?), in his <i>Hist. Sacr.</i> lib. II. &sect; 1, gives an
outline of the story of Susanna, after the events of Dan. i. and before
those of chap, ii., evidently regarding it as historical.</p>

<p>CHRYSOSTOM (&#8224;407) has a sermon &quot;de Susanna,&quot; in which he compares her to
the &quot;garden enclosed&quot; of Solomon's Song iv. 12 (quoted in Arnald's
<i>Commentary</i>).</p>

<p>JEROME (&#8224;420), in his <i>de Nominibus Hebraicis</i>, includes, under the Book
of Daniel, Susanna and Joacim without any distinction from the names in
the rest of the book (ed. Vallarsi, vol. III.).</p>

<p>AUGUSTINE (&#8224;430) draws, in <i>de Civ. Dei</i>, I. 19, a parallel between
Susanna and Lucretia, greatly to <a class="pagenum" title="168" id="page168"></a>the advantage of the former. Arnald,
on v. 23, gives some extracts from this.</p>

<p>CYRIL OF ALEXANDRIA (&#8224;444) quotes v. 56 at least twice, viz. on Hos.
xii. 8 and on Zeph. i. 11. In the latter case he speaks of it as <span xml:lang="el">&#960;&#945;&#961;&#940; &#947;&#949;

<p>THEODORET (&#8224;457) quotes in Letter CX., Susanna 22; but in his comment on
Daniel, Susanna is not contained.</p>

<p>MAMERTUS CLAUDIANUS (&#8224;474). The following occurs in a hymn attributed to
this writer, &quot;<i xml:lang="la">In Jacobum magistrum equitum</i>,&quot; but which Migne says is
'<span xml:lang="la">dubi&aelig; auctoritatis</span>': &quot;<span xml:lang="la">Sic tibi det vires sancta Susanna suas.</span>&quot;</p>

<p>NICEPHORUS OF CONSTANTINOPLE (&#8224;828) classes Susanna among his
&quot;antilegomena.&quot; As he makes no separate mention in his lists of the
Song, or of Bel and the Dragon, he presumably reckons them under
'Daniel'<a id="fnt55" href="#fn55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> (Migne, <i>Patr. gr.</i> c. 1056). At the end of
pseudo-Athanasius' <i>Synopsis S.S.</i> comes a list of <span xml:lang="el">&#954;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#957;&#953;&#950;&#972;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#945;</span>, so
similar to Nicephorus' list in order and contents as to suggest that
they had some close connection; and it is possible that this appendage
may be of even later date than the Synopsis itself, which <a class="pagenum" title="169" id="page169"></a>may be
attributed to the 6th century (Loisy, <i>A.T.</i>, p. 147).</p>

<p>The above are specimens of the numerous references made to Susanna by
early Christian writers, both Greek and Latin, who evidently found in
her a favourite instance to adduce in support of their teaching. Nor
ought we, in such a matter, to treat lightly the tenor of Christian
antiquity so remarkably manifested.</p>

<h5>Art.</h5>

<p>From early times scenes from Susanna were often chosen for artistic
treatment. In &quot;a list of the symbols most frequently represented in
painting or sculpture by the Church of the first seven centuries&quot;
Susanna is included (<i>D.C.A.</i> art. <i>Symbolism</i>).</p>

<p>Frescoes of Susanna and the Elders occur, though not with great
frequency, in the Catacombs (<i>D.C.A.</i> I. art. <i>Fresco</i>, 700a). W.
Lowrie, in his <i>Christian Art</i> (N.Y. and Lond. 1901, p. 210), mentions a
second-century fresco of Susanna and the Elders judged by Daniel, in the
cemetery of Callistus; also he says, &quot;in the Capella gr&aelig;ca in St.
Priscilla the story is depicted with unusual dramatic interest in
several scenes.&quot; Three old Italian sarcophagi have bas-reliefs of
Susanna and the Elders <a class="pagenum" title="170" id="page170"></a>as emblematic of the Church enduring
persecution; others are known in southern Gaul (<i>D.C.A.</i> art. <i>Church,
Symbols of</i>). A woodcut is given in this article of a sheep (ewe?)
between two wild beasts (wolves?), 'Susanna' and 'Senioris' being
written over them respectively, the artist evidently fearing that the
symbolism might otherwise not be perceived.</p>

<p>Scenes from the history of Susanna carved on sarcophagi are more
frequent in France than in Italy. It has been thought that the two
Elders may be taken to represent the two older forms of religion, the
Pagan and the Jewish (<i>D.C.A., O.T. in Art</i>, II. 1459b). In the same
Dict. (<i>Sculpture</i>, II. 1867a) it is noted that the cycle of subjects
has a remarkable correspondence with those named in the Roman Breviary
&quot;<span xml:lang="la">Ordo commendationis anim&aelig;</span>,&quot; where &quot;<span xml:lang="la">Libera, Dom. animam servi tui sicut
liberasti Sus. de falso crimine</span>,&quot; is one of the petitions.</p>

<p>It is fair to presume that Delitzsch refers to some of the above when he
writes, &quot;<span xml:lang="la">Susann&aelig; historia in sarcophagis veterum Christianorum cum
sacris historiis insculpta conspicitur</span>&quot; (<i>op. cit.</i> 26).</p>

<p>In the Brit. Mus., 2nd North Gallery, Room V., there is a glass fragment
of the 4th century, found at Cologne, representing (probably) Susanna
amongst <a class="pagenum" title="171" id="page171"></a>other subjects. She also appears on a carved ivory reliquary of
Brescia, which is most likely not later in date than 800 (<i>D.C.A.</i> art.
<i>Reliquary</i>, II. 1780b).</p>

<p>In the Byzantine Guide to Painting (<span xml:lang="el">&#7961;&#961;&#956;&#951;&#957;&#949;&#943;&#945; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#950;&#969;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#953;&#954;&#8134;&#962;</span>), given in
Didron's <i>Christian Iconography</i> (Bohn's ed., Lond. 1886, I. 45<i>n</i>, II.
284), 'Daniel defends Susanna' is put immediately after the scene in
Dan. i. 15, and before the other scenes given out of Daniel (<i>cf.</i>
'Position,' p. 109). Didron's MS. of this work is probably of the 15th
century, though the monks of Athos, whence it appears to have come,
regarded it as some five centuries older.</p>

<p>There is a window of stained glass, said to be <i>cinque-cento</i>, in the
westernmost bay of the south aisle of St. James' Church, Bury St.
Edmunds, of which the three lower lights represent the trial of Susanna.
In the centre Susanna's bath takes the form of a deep font, in which she
is standing. The Elders are clothed in purple.<a id="fnt56" href="#fn56"><sup>[56]</sup></a></p>

<div id="fn56" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt56">[56]</a> There is a very quaint note in Gwillim's <i>Heraldry</i> (1611,
p. 109)
as to a mulberry figured on a shield, &quot;This fruit hath a purple blushing
colour, in the one resembling the judges' attire who attempted Susanna,
in the other that hue of their face which should have been in them, if
they had been so gracious to blush at their fault,&quot; etc.</p>
</div>

<p>In Sumner's <i>Antiquities of Canterbury</i>, 1703, the second figure in the
third window of the cathe<a class="pagenum" title="172" id="page172"></a>dral is described as &quot;Daniel in medio
seniorum,&quot; and this inscription is given:</p>

<blockquote>
<p xml:lang="la">&quot;Mirantur pueri seniores voce doceri<br />
Sic responsa dei sensum stupent Pharas&aelig;i.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(Reprinted in <i>Ancient Glass Painting</i>, by an Amateur, Oxf. 1848, p.
355.)</p>

<p>In the scheme of stained glass for Truro cathedral there are several
apocryphal subjects, including a window in the south-east transept
having &quot;Susanna and the Mother of the Seven Martyrs&quot; for its subjects
(Donaldson, <i>Bishopric of Truro</i>, 1902, App. V.).</p>

<p>A carved chimney-piece exists in Chillingham Castle, Northumberland,
representing Susanna and the Elders (Murray, <i>Handbook to
Northumberland</i>, 1873, p. 326).</p>

<p>This scene has been a wonderfully popular one with painters. Altdorfer,
Carracci, Correggio, A. Coypel, van Dyck, Guercino, Rembrandt, Rubens,
Santerre, Tintoretto, Valentin, and P. Veronese may be named amongst
those who have treated it. A picture entitled 'Susanna' was exhibited in
the Royal Academy, London, in 1886, by Fred. Goodall, R.A.</p>

<p>Thus we see that the many picturesque incidents in this Addition have
not been overlooked by Chris<a class="pagenum" title="173" id="page173"></a>tian artists in search of subjects for the
brush or the chisel. Of these three supplementary sections of Daniel the
History of Susanna has, in this respect, been found much the most
suggestive; probably as the one which is thought to contain the highest
passion and feeling.</p>
</div>

<div id="part3_12" class="section">
<h4>&quot;Example Of Life And Instruction Of Manners.&quot;</h4>

<p>In the character of <i>Susanna</i> we see unconquerable <i>Purity</i> in thought
and deed; prayerful <i>Trust</i> in God under a false and cruel
accusation,<a id="fnt57" href="#fn57"><sup>[57]</sup></a> and, in the face of death, securing deliverance from an
unexpected quarter (<i>cf.</i> v. 60 with II. Cor. i. 10). With v. 55
Hippolytus compares Tob. iii. 2 (Vulgate). The parallels drawn by St.
Chrysostom and St. Augustine will be found under 'Early Christian
Literature,' p. 167. Susanna's trouble may be taken as a conspicuous
illustration of Ps. xxxiv. 19.</p>

<div id="fn57" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt57">[57]</a> There are similar instances in chaps. iii. and vi. of the
canonical
Daniel. See also the <i>Notes on Scripture, in loco, of</i> Bishop Wilson, of
Sodor and Man, who tells what comfort he derived from hearing Susanna
read in the daily service when himself falsely accused.</p>
</div>

<p>Susanna was conscientious as well as <a class="pagenum" title="174" id="page174"></a>pure; would not lie, being tenderly
nurtured morally as well as physically.<a id="fnt58" href="#fn58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> She had the virtue of
bodily cleanliness as well as social purity, and affords an early
instance of the use of the prepared bath.</p>

<div id="fn58" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt58">[58]</a> Thackeray's mention of Susanna in <i>Tht Newcomes</i>, chap,
lvi., seems
pointless, though that in chap. xix. is suitable enough. Steele has an
absurd reference in the <i>Spectator</i>, No. 14, to the &quot;opera of Susanna,
or Innocence Betrayed, which will be exhibited next week, with a pair of
new Elders.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>It is noticeable, too, that no unfavourable traits develop themselves on
the re-establishment of her happiness and the condemnation of her
slanderers; there is no excessive reaction to unbecoming laxity, no
<span xml:lang="el">&#7940;&#963;&#967;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#957; &#960;&#961;&#8118;&#947;&#956;&#945;</span>.</p>

<p>In the character of the <i>Elders</i> we see judicial position and feigned
piety used as a cloak for lust and slander; great hardness of heart in
condemning Susanna to death, with the full knowledge that she was
innocent; unblushing effrontery (v. 50); sins of the tongue in 'lying
and slandering.'</p>

<p>Hooker (<i>Ecc. Pol.</i> V. 2) refers, according to the marginal note (though
they are not named in the text), to these Elders as examples of
&quot;affected atheism,&quot; &quot;where the windows of the soul are of very set
purpose closed&quot;; &quot;they turned away their mind and cast down their eyes,
that they might not see heaven nor remember just judgments.&quot; St.
Hip<a class="pagenum" title="175" id="page175"></a>polytus on v. 61 quotes Prov. xxvi. 27 very appositely. The fall of
the Elders shews the need for our Lord's order in St. Matt. v. 28, and
the terrible results of acting otherwise.</p>

<p>The individual character of each Elder has a little light thrown upon it
by the form of condemnation framed by Daniel. That of the first is
chiefly based on his unjust judgment, that of the second on his lewd
conduct, each judgment being varied in this way according to the form of
his previous iniquities. The knowledge which Daniel possessed of these
appropriately determined the cast of his sentence. That he had some
acquaintance with their former habits is shewn by vv. 52, 53, 56.</p>

<p>The change to the plural in v. 57 is difficult to explain, and does not
receive attention at the hands of the commentators; in fact Ball applies
this verse, without mentioning the change of number, to the one Elder
only. Although these godless judges failed in accomplishing their
purpose, they were not on this account less scandalous betrayers of
virtue.</p>

<p>In Susanna's <i>Servants</i> we see fidelity, sympathy, and no eagerness to
believe an ill report. As regards Susanna, this fact speaks volumes for
the excellence of her conduct.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="176" id="page176"></a>In <i>Daniel</i> we see the courage and penetrating acumen which are so
characteristic of his whole career, impressing all with whom he was
brought into contact. He weighs a matter carefully before coming to a
decision. By unmasking hypocrisy and securing justice he is delighted to
set right a grievous wrong.<a id="fnt59" href="#fn59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> He appears as the best judge (<i>cf.</i> the
estimation shewn of the justice of God by Azarias, Song of the Three,
4-8). Daniel further exhibits a decision and an absence of
self-distrust, in undertaking tasks of great risk, quite in accordance
with his character as portrayed in the canonical book, and in Bel and
the Dragon. In each case he is alert, acute, and fearless; his conduct
in different circumstances is quite in keeping with itself. Using his
talents thoroughly, he makes &quot;full proof of his ministry.&quot;</p>

<div id="fn59" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt59">[59]</a> St. Antony of Padua curiously gives vv.. 52, 56, as an example of
the &quot;Zeal of prelates&quot; (<i>Moral Concordance,</i> Neale's edit., n.d., p.
105).</p>
</div>

<p>There is a strong resemblance in ideas, though not much in words,
between Daniel's sentence in v. 55 and St. Matt. xxiv. 51. The judgment
of Daniel in this case may be taken as a type of the Last Judgment,
correcting the unjust judgments of this world.</p>

<p>A high value is set on Scripture, as v. 53 <a class="pagenum" title="177" id="page177"></a>shews, where it is quoted as
an authoritative rule of conduct; v. 5, too, if it is to be regarded as
a reference to Jer. xxix. 23, points to a similar high esteem for it as
the word of the Lord. Susanna herself in v. 22 evidently remembers
David's words in II. Sam. xxiv. 14, when he too had to make his choice
between falling into the hand of the Lord or the hand of man, thus
shewing her ready knowledge of the O.T.</p>

<p>Much admirable moral teaching therefore may be drawn from the characters
of this little work of world-wide interest, teaching which is needed in
all nations and in all periods.</p>

<h4>Title And Position.</h4>

<h5>Title.</h5>

<p><span xml:lang="el">&#914;&#942;&#955; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#916;&#961;&#940;&#954;&#969;&#957;</span> is the usual title of this booklet. It is obviously
derived from the names of the two idols destroyed in the two portions of
the story. But Cod. Chis. has the curious heading, <span xml:lang="el">&#7960;&#954; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#951;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945;&#962;
&#7944;&#956;&#946;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#8058;&#956; &#965;&#7985;&#959;&#8166; &#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166; &#7952;&#954; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#966;&#965;&#955;&#8134;&#962; &#923;&#949;&#965;&#943;</span> (<i>cf.</i> v. 33). The Syriac also has
the equivalent of this. In some Syriac MSS. 'Dragon' is given as a
separate title before v. 23; and Luther's version, at the same point,
expands this into 'von Drachen zu Babel.'</p>

<p>In Codd. A, Q, the entire piece is headed <span xml:lang="el">&#8005;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#953;&#946;&#8189;</span>, and is thus
treated as an integral part of Daniel, finishing the book, the 12th
chapter of which ends in Cod. A with <span xml:lang="el">&#8005;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#953;&#945;&#8189;</span>.<a id="fnt61" href="#fn61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> In B it follows, if
possible, still more closely, there being no intermediate heading<a id="fnt62" href="#fn62"><sup>[62]</sup></a>,
In Cod. A, at the end, there is <span xml:lang="el">&#964;&#941;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#916;&#945;&#957;. &#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#942;&#964;&#959;&#965;</span>, which, except in
the case of Ruth, is not A's usual way of terminating works. The Arabic
Version in Walton also superscribes it as a 'vision' (Scholz, p. 139).</p>

<div id="fn61" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt61">[61]</a> The title <span xml:lang="el">&#8005;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span> is also used in Q
in some of Isaiah's visions,
<i>e.g.</i> xvii. 1.</p>

</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="183" id="page183"></a>The title 'the book of the little Daniel' seems applied to Bel and the
Dragon in a Nestorian list mentioned by Churton (p. 389), and seemingly
in Ebed Jesu's list of Hippolytus' works (<i>D.C.B.</i> art. <i>Hippolytus</i>,
III. p. 104a). This title, which usually belongs to Susanna, when
applied to Bel and the Dragon, must refer, not to Daniel's age, but to
the size of the book. Delitzsch (<i>op. cit.</i> 25n) mentions, without
further description, one MS. from Mount Athos which entitles it <span xml:lang="el">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8166;
&#7944;&#946;&#946;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#956;</span>.</p>

<p>The source of the marginal reading of A.V. &quot;Bel's Dragon&quot; (also given in
the title to Susanna) does not appear to be identified.</p>

<h5>Position.</h5>

<p>As to the place of this piece in some of the Greek MSS. <i>see</i> above.</p>

<p>Professor A. Scholz (<i xml:lang="de">Judith und Bel und der Drache,</i> W&uuml;rzburg, 1896, p.
200) finds fault with Holmes and Parsons for having disturbed the
position of this book without offering sufficient indication of having
done so: &quot;<span xml:lang="de">die St&uuml;cke willk&uuml;rlich versetzt sind</span>.&quot;</p>

<p>In the Vulgate it is reckoned as chap. xiv. of Daniel, coming after
Susanna, which forms chap. xiii., <a class="pagenum" title="184" id="page184"></a>as also in the Hexaplar Syriac. Caj.
Bugati, in his edition of this text, regards its ascription to Habakkuk
as a reason for its detached position at the end (<i>see</i> 'Authorship,' p.
186).</p>

<p>J. F&uuml;rst's idea (quoted by Bissell, p. 444), that the work was
originally incorporated in chap. vi., seems far less likely than his
conjecture with regard to the position of Susanna (<i>q.v.</i>). Indeed,
except for a certain similarity in the lions' den miracle, it is not
easy to see why it should be joined to any part of chap. vi. Nor do the
similar points of the den incidents seem any real ground for making one
story follow directly upon the other.</p>

<p>E. Philippe (Vigouroux <i>Dict.</i> II. 1266) attempts, rather feebly, to
account for its omission from the Hebrew Bibles. He says, &quot;<span xml:lang="fr">elle parut &agrave;
tort aux Juifs faire double emploi avec un r&eacute;cit pareil, VI.</span>&quot; This seems
to be a gratuitous supposition of no great probability.</p>

<p>As the story deals with the latter part of Daniel's life, its place at
the conclusion of the book is very fitting. In Cod. A the subscription
mentioned above, marking it as the &quot;end of Daniel the prophet,&quot;
distinctly attaches it to the Book of Daniel, and precludes further
additions. On the whole, if <a class="pagenum" title="185" id="page185"></a>its connection with the Book of Daniel is
to be recognized, this position at the close may be regarded as the most
suitable.</p>
</div>

<div id="part4_2" class="section">
<h4>Authorship.</h4>

<p>In &#920;, Bel and the Dragon is apparently assumed to be by the same writer
as the rest of the Book of Daniel. So in <i>Breshith Rabbah</i><a id="fnt63" href="#fn63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> on Gen.
xxxvii. 24 we have nearly the words of v. 28 <i>sq.</i>, introduced by &quot;This
is as it is written in Daniel&quot; (Ball, 344a). In Raymund Martini's
<i>Pugio fidei</i> (Paris, 1651, p. 740) the Aramaic is given as <span xml:lang="he">&#1489;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500;</span>
(<i>see</i> under 'Chronology,' p. 229).</p>

<div id="fn63" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt63">[63]</a> This has been attributed to Rabba bar Nachman of Pumbaditha,
about
A.D. 300, but is probably later. <i>See</i>, however, Etheridge, <i>Jerus. and
Tiberias</i>, p. 143.</p>
</div>

<p>If, however, it be presumed that Daniel is not the author, we are left
without any clue to the writer's name, except what is afforded us by the
LXX title, which treats the piece as an extract from a prophecy of
Habakkuk, son of Jesus. Most probably the minor prophet of that name is
intended, though this has been doubted on chronological and on
genealogical grounds; and the position of Bel and the Dragon in the MSS.
lends no countenance to a connection with Habakkuk's prophecy.
Roth<a class="pagenum" title="186" id="page186"></a>stein nevertheless, in Kautzsch, <i>Apocr.</i> (p. 178), regards it as
certain that the minor prophet is meant; and so likewise do Sch&uuml;rer and
Driver in their articles in Hauck's <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia</i> (I. 639), and in
Hastings' <i>D.B.</i> respectively; and Keil, who is referred to below (p.
188).</p>

<p>Still, it is curious that a Levite of the name of Jesus, who had sons,
is mentioned in I. Esd. v. 58, and elsewhere in the same book. Further
evidence, however, which might connect him with the LXX title, is not
forthcoming. But it is noticeable that in Hab. ii. 18 <i>sq.</i> idolatry,
probably Chaldean, is scoffed at in a tone not dissimilar to that of
this work.</p>

<p>Eusebius and Apollinarius, in controversy with Porphyry, accept this
title as correct (Churton, 390b). So Bugati (Milan, 1788, p. 163)
treats the authorship of Habakkuk as the reason of the detached position
of the fragment at the end of the book. Hesychius of Jerusalem, quoted
under 'Early Christian Literature,' declines to express an opinion as to
the identity of Habakkuk. The <i>Synopsis sacr. Script.</i>&mdash;referred to by
Ball (350b) and Bissell (447) as if a genuine work of
Athanasius&mdash;perhaps affords ground for a third theory. For it makes
mention (after N.T. <a class="pagenum" title="187" id="page187"></a>books, &sect; 75) of a certain pseudo-epigraphic writing
of <span xml:lang="el">&#7944;&#956;&#946;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#956;</span> which might perhaps be the &#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#951;&#964;&#949;&#943;&#945; named in the LXX title.
All things considered, the theory that the well-known prophet Habakkuk
was meant by LXX seems the most probable.</p>

<p>But if Bel and the Dragon be merely the crystallization of what is
called a 'fluid myth,' or traditional floating story, its original
authorship is not merely unknown, but is undiscoverable, and was
probably a doubtful matter even to those who first rendered it into
Greek. This view accounts too, as nothing else seems satisfactorily to
do, for the many changes, insertions, and omissions in different
versions. Such stories, at any rate in their earlier days, are subject
to variation in many points as the result of oral repetition. Still, the
'fluidity' of this piece is by no means so great as that of Tobit, where
the variations are on a much wider scale.</p>

<p>If the 'fluid myth' theory be accepted, the original becomes an
anonymous story, built up on the renown of Daniel, a piece of Haggadah
in fact, as some, not unreasonably, have ventured to think; such as J.W.
Etheridge, who classes these pieces under that head, or, as he styles
them, &quot;histories coloured with fable&quot; (<i>Jerusalem and Tiberias</i>, <a class="pagenum" title="188" id="page188"></a>Lond.
1856, p. 109). Reuss regards it as still more imaginative, deeming all
except the temple to be &quot;<span xml:lang="de">reine Erfindung, und zwar eine ziemlich
geistlose</span>&quot; (<i>O.T.</i> VII. 269). But Prof. Sayce thinks that &quot;the author
was better acquainted with Babylon and Babylonian history than the other
apocryphal writers&quot; (<i>Temple Bible</i>, 'Tobit,' etc., Lond. 1903, pp. xiv,
95).</p>

<p>Furthermore it must be remembered that even if Bel and the Dragon was
added to Daniel as an appendix by a later hand, there may still be truth
in the story; its erroneousness is not necessarily proved, nor is it
needful to assume, as is sometimes done, that all its events are
fictitious. This seems to be done by G.H. Curteis (S.P.C.K. <i>Comm.</i>,
'Introd. to Hab.'), who writes: &quot;The absurd legends with which the
Rabbis and the author of Bel and the Dragon amused themselves are not
worthy of serious attention.&quot; And Keil also, in his <i>Commentary on the
Minor Prophets</i>, while accepting the superscription of Cod. Chis. as
supporting Habakkuk's Levitic origin, regards the rest of the legend as
&quot;quite worthless&quot; (Clark's translation, pp. 49, 50). So, too, W.J. Deane
(<i>Pulpit Bible</i>, 1898, 'Hab.' p. 111) says, &quot;The whole account is
plainly unhistorical, and <a class="pagenum" title="189" id="page189"></a>its connection with the canonical writer
cannot be maintained for a moment.&quot;</p>

<p>Supposing the story to be true, however, it may form an instance, both
at its outset and its close, of what is recorded in Dan. vi. 28, of
Daniel prospering in the reign of Cyrus the Persian. But, in the present
state of our knowledge, speculations lead to no positive result, for the
real author cannot be determined.</p>
</div>

<div id="part4_3" class="section">
<h4>Date And Place Of Writing.</h4>

<h5>Date.</h5>

<p>The idea, which may be a true one, that this is the latest of these
three appendices, seems chiefly founded on its position at the end of
Daniel, and on its subject-matter, which contains indications of
belonging to the prophet's latter years. Having passed safely through
many trials, he now boldly laughs at the idols of Babylon (vv. 7, 19).
His contempt is unconcealed, and he again confidently risks his life for
the true God. In v. 19 we also find him venturing to hold the king
back&mdash;<span xml:lang="el">&#7952;&#954;&#961;&#940;&#964;&#951;&#963;&#949;&#957; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#941;&#945;</span> (&#920;). Long experience in surmounting great
difficulties by divine help had strengthened his nerve and confirmed his
faith.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="190" id="page190"></a><i>Original.</i> If the LXX be taken as a translation, the original is of
course older than the Greek text, but not necessarily much older. If the
statement at the head, however, be accepted as referring to Habakkuk the
prophet, the original is of course thrown back to a much earlier date,
say <i>circ.</i> 600 B.C., and Hebrew, not Aramaic, would be the language.
But this theory will scarcely commend itself to many (<i>cf.</i>
'Chronology,' p. 223).</p>

<p><i>LXX.</i> There seems no reason to doubt that Bel and the Dragon always
formed a part of this Greek version of Daniel. Pusey (quoted in Churton,
<i>Uncan. and Apocr. Script</i>, p. 389) speaks of it as 'contemporary with
the LXX,' while Rothstein (Kautzsch, 178, 9) attributes it to the second
century B.C., being probably of the same date as Susanna.</p>

<p><i>Theodotion.</i> This version may reasonably be assigned to the second
century A.D. But it has been pretty clearly shewn that Theodotion worked
up some Greek version other than the LXX. Many of the quotations from
Daniel in the N.T., and especially those in Revelation (specified in
<i>D.C.B.</i> art. <i>Theodotion</i>, IV. 975b), shew that a version largely
corresponding with his existed at the time when these quotations were
made. The Book of Baruch also <a class="pagenum" title="191" id="page191"></a>(same art. 976a) bears evidence of the
employment of this Theodotionic ground-version, the origin of which is
at present unknown. In this connection compare Prof. Swete's <i>Introd. to
Greek O.T.</i> ed. 2, p. 48, and Sch&uuml;rer's pointed saying, quoted there in
note (3), &quot;<span xml:lang="de">Entweder Th. selbst ist &auml;lter als die Apostel, oder es hat
einen 'Th.' vor Th. gegeben.</span>&quot; There seems little reason to doubt that
the unnamed previous version extended to this and the other Additions to
Daniel.</p>

<h5>Place.</h5>

<p><i>Original</i> (Semitic?). Babylonia, or possibly Palestine. &quot; The writer,&quot;
says Bissell on v. 2, &quot;shews a familiar acquaintance with what was the
probable state of things in Babylon when the event narrated is supposed
to have occurred.&quot;</p>

<p>Of the things mentioned, clay is common in Babylonia, and brass or
bronze was used as a material for images; and the lion was an inhabitant
of the country.</p>

<p>There is no sign (in this piece) of Hellenic thought influencing Jewish
belief, such as would have been likely to shew itself in a purely
Alexandrian production. The strong hatred of idolatry is quite in
accordance with a Babylonish origin; more <a class="pagenum" title="192" id="page192"></a>so perhaps than with an
Alexandrian. <i>Cf.</i> Jer. xliv. 8, which seems to shew that, at any rate
in the early days of the dispersion in Egypt, the severance from
idolatry was not so sharp as in Babylonia.</p>

<p>The mention of pitch (v. 27) as a readily obtainable commodity is
inconclusive, as stated under the corresponding section of Part II. The
possible confusion between <span xml:lang="he">&#1494;&#1510;&#1508;&#1488;</span> (storm-wind) and <span xml:lang="he">&#1494;&#1497;&#1508;&#1488;</span> (pitch), pointed
out by Marshall in his article on Bel and the Dragon in Hastings'
<i>Dict.</i>, does not look probable as occurring in a list of substances of
this kind.</p>

<p><i>LXX.</i> Alexandria may be pretty certainly named. What Bishop Westcott
calls &quot;an Alexandrine hand&quot; (<i>D.B.</i> I. p. 448 ed. 1, 714 ed. 2) has been
generally deemed apparent. So Bissell says: &quot;The contents furnish
tolerably safe evidence of its Egyptian origin.&quot; But this does not seem
to agree very well with his note on v. 2, quoted at the beginning of
this chapter.</p>

<p>It might have been thought that the weights and measures which enter
into this story in v. 3 of both versions, and in v. 27 of LXX, would
have afforded some valuable local indications. But unfortunately for
this requirement, the weights and <a class="pagenum" title="193" id="page193"></a>measures of the ancient world were so
much assimilated as to yield, in the question before us, no certain
clue. Alexandria too, being a great commercial centre, had become
somewhat syncretistic. As P. Smith remarks, in his article <i>Mensura</i>, in
<i>D. Gk. &amp; Rom. A.</i> (1872, p. 754b), &quot;The Roman system, which was
probably derived from the Greek, agreed with the Babylonian both in
weights and measures.&quot; It is stated, however, in Hastings' <i>D.B.</i> (IV.
911b, 913b) that <span xml:lang="el">&#7936;&#961;&#964;&#940;&#946;&#945;&#953;</span> and <span xml:lang="el">&#956;&#949;&#964;&#961;&#951;&#964;&#945;&#943;</span> were identified at Alexandria,
in which case they may have been used here as rough equivalents for the
translation of some Semitic words, such as <span xml:lang="he">&#1495;&#1476;&#1502;&#1462;&#1512;</span> and <span xml:lang="he">&#1505;&#1456;&#1488;&#1464;&#1492;</span> in Isai. v.
10 and I. Kings xviii. 32 respectively. The <span xml:lang="el">&#956;&#957;&#8118;</span> of v. 27 is also both
Babylonian and Alexandrian (<i>see</i> Hastings' <i>D.B.</i> iv. 904a). The
signs, from this source, of local origin must not therefore be pressed.</p>

<p><i>Theodotion.</i> From what little we know of this translator's life, it is
not improbable that he made his version at Ephesus.</p>

<p>The genitive form <span xml:lang="el">&#956;&#945;&#967;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#951;&#962;</span> in v. 26, thought to be Ionic, may lend a
little support to this. <i>Cf.</i> Heb. xi. 34, Rev. xiii. 14, in A; B here
failing; yet it is found in B, by the first corrector, in St. Luke xxi.
24. But <i>cf.</i> Swete's <i>Introd.</i> p. 304. On the <a class="pagenum" title="194" id="page194"></a>other hand, the use of
<span xml:lang="el">&#963;&#974;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span> in v. 32 (&#920; only) for 'slaves' is given by Deissmann (p. 160) as
an example of Egyptian usage. It is found in Gen. xxxiv. 29, Tob. x. 10,
and elsewhere. Its use by Polybius (mentioned without reference by
Deissmann) does not give us much 'local' assistance, for his travels
were so extensive that he may have picked it up in various places. But
its occurrence in Rev. xviii. 13 may suggest that it was in use at
Ephesus also. Deissmann (p. 117) also thinks <span xml:lang="el">&#7952;&#948;&#945;&#960;&#945;&#957;&#8182;&#957;&#964;&#959; &#949;&#7984;&#962;</span> (v. 3) to be
an Alexandrian idiom; but in the same verse we find the spelling
<span xml:lang="el">&#961;&#940;&#954;&#959;&#965;&#964;&#945;</span>, which is considered by Liddell and Scott to be an Ionic form.
The indications therefore of this linguistic kind nearly counterbalance
one another.</p>

<h4>For Whom And With What Object Written.</h4>

<p>This story was evidently composed for Jewish use, not improbably for
Jews who had returned from the Captivity, as a popular memorial of
Babylonish days. And perhaps the general tenor of the piece implies that
it was written to serve, not so much to convert idolaters, as for the
encouragement of those who were striving, or had striven, to maintain
the <a class="pagenum" title="195" id="page195"></a>faith among the heathen. Its tone and subject make its composition
in the first instance for Babylonian Jews, or Palestinian Jews returned
from captivity, more likely than for their Alexandrian brethren. To
these latter, however, it soon found its way. But it is amongst
Christian people that this narrative has had its longest and deepest
influence. The more it was valued by Christians the less it seemed
regarded by Jews. In this respect its fate was similar to that of the
entire LXX.</p>

<p>A distinct moral purpose is not obscurely indicated by the trend of the
whole story. It is not merely a record of two interesting episodes in
the prophet's later days, but it also aims at a definite religious
object. That object is to throw contempt on idolatry, whether directed
to inanimate or animate things; to honour Daniel as vindicator of the
true worship; and to shew that the adoration of heathen deities is lying
and deceptive, and ought to be supplanted by that of the Lord.</p>

<p>It is evidently desired to put both idols and idolaters into ridiculous
positions, not for mere amusement, but in order to destroy the
confidence which was groundlessly placed in them. The weapons of sarcasm
and contemptuous treatment are <a class="pagenum" title="196" id="page196"></a>used with success, even as Elijah
employed them on Baal and his worshippers at an earlier time (I. Kings
xviii. 27). A desire to convert the heathen, by proving the absurdity of
their idol-worship, may be inferred from the last clause of v. 27,
compared with vv. 5, 25. As the history of Susanna deals with errors of
Jewish practice, so does this writing with the errors of heathenism.</p>

<p>The providence of God in protecting those who suffer for His sake is
clearly inculcated in the latter portion of the work. A sense of this
would, with other results, give confidence in the fight against
idolatry; the more needed because Bel was evidently a very popular deity
with high and low, and difficult to dislodge. The frequent compounding
of 'Bel' with proper names (Belshazzar and Belteshazzar)<a id="fnt64" href="#fn64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> shews the
regard in which he was held. Compare the similar compounding of
'Jehovah' amongst the Jews. But, although Bel was deemed a beneficent
deity, being, as Gesenius <a class="pagenum" title="197" id="page197"></a>calls him (s.v. <span xml:lang="he">&#1489;&#1461;&#1468;&#1500;</span> sub <span xml:lang="he">&#1489;&#1468;&#1463;&#1510;&#1463;&#1500;</span>),
'agathodemon, omnis felicitatis auctor,' Daniel does not spare him on
that account. Thomas &quot;Wintle<a id="fnt65" href="#fn65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> suggests that the image in chap. iii.
&quot;was Bel, or some of the Assyrian deities, as we may collect from iii.
14&quot;; and Bar-Hebr&aelig;us' notion that the gift of Bel to Daniel, in v. 22 of
our story, was in order that he might be rewarded by the gold with which
the image was plated, agrees well enough with iii. I (Berlin, 1888, p.
28).</p>

<div id="fn64" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt64">[64]</a> Schrader, <i>Cuneiform Inscriptions of O.T.</i><sup>2</sup> II. 125,
considers Bel
not to enter explicitly into the second of these names, which he takes
to mean 'may his life protect'; but even in this case the mention of a
Deity is evidently understood. But <i>cf.</i> Dan. iv. 8. Gesenius and
Longfield (<i>Chaldee Grammar</i>, 1859, p. 115) take the older view. <i>See</i>
also Sayce's art. in Hastings' <i>D.B.</i> on <i>Merodach-Baladan</i>, where M.
seems identified with Bel; also art. <i>Merodach.</i></p>
</div>

<p><a href="#fnt65">[65]</a> <i>Daniel</i>, Oxf. 1792, p. 40.</p>
</div>

<p>The aim is to depict Daniel, distinguished for his wisdom and piety, as
the successful, though sorely tried, opponent of heathenism, and as the
representative of the Living God. His character to a great extent
resembles that pourtrayed in the rest of the work bearing his name. It
is shewn how he continued to face and to solve the difficult problems of
court life in Babylon. And albeit he secured no small measure of fame,
and perhaps of popularity, at the time, these earthly results, in their
abiding form, it has lain with posterity to give him.</p>

<p>On the supposition that Alexandria was the birthplace of the piece, it
has been suggested that the aim of the writer was &quot;to warn against the
sin of idolatry some of his brethren who had embraced <a class="pagenum" title="198" id="page198"></a>Egyptian
superstition.&quot;<a id="fnt66" href="#fn66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> But no special reference to Egyptian forms of
idolatry is apparent in support of this view, which seems based on
little more than a wish to fit in the idolatry with the theory of the
story having an Alexandrian origin.</p>

<div id="fn66" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt66">[66]</a> <i>Chambers's Encyclop.</i>, 1888, art. <i>Bel.</i></p>
</div>

<p>A. Scholz's notion that the whole piece is a 'vision' with allegoric or
apocalyptic meanings only, and never intended to be taken as history,
looks like a wonderfully forced hypothesis, laying a great strain on the
imaginations both of the writer and the reader. The book having been
received as canonical in the Roman communion, its contents must at all
hazards be reconciled with the maintenance of that position. Yet it is
fair to note that Luther, on other grounds, regarded Susanna and Bel and
the Dragon as pretty spiritual fictions, in which history must take its
chance (Z&ouml;ckler, p. 216).</p>
</div>

<div id="part4_5" class="section">
<h4>Integrity And State Of The Text.</h4>

<p>This double story seems to have been treated as one in the Greek. In the
Syriac and Arabic versions the Dragon has a separate title (noticed in
A.V. margin, &quot;Some add this title <i>of the Dragon</i>'). The former,
strangely enough, has 'end of Daniel' before <a class="pagenum" title="199" id="page199"></a>this title. And in the
Syro-Chaldee version, given in Midrash <i>Rabbah de Rabbah</i>, Bel has a
subscription, and the Dragon a fresh title (<i>see</i> Ball, 345a).</p>

<p>In v. 23 <span xml:lang="el">&#7952;&#957; &#964;&#8183; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8183; &#964;&#972;&#960;&#8179;</span> (&#927;&#8189;) are wanting as connecting words in B, but
the reference to Bel in v. 28 serves to consolidate the two portions of
the story. A and Q also, as well as correctors of B, have an additional
clause in v. 24, which pre-supposes the former portion of the piece, a
clause given in A.V. and R.V. The <span xml:lang="el">&#954;&#945;&#943;</span> of <span xml:lang="el">&#956;&#8052; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#959;&#8166;&#964;&#959;&#957;</span> in &#927;&#8189; answers the
same purpose. Daniel's mocking tone at the end of v. 27 agrees well with
his sense of humour in v. 7. Cyrus' ready compliance, too, in v. 26 is
only accounted for fully by the shock given to his idolatrous beliefs in
the Bel part of the story. And so far the internal evidence argues for
the unity of the piece. But it is noticeable that the Epistle for
Tuesday after the Fifth Sunday in Lent in the Sarum and Roman Missals
consists of the Dragon story only, beginning at v. 29, with some slight
introductory changes.</p>

<p>And Gaster's recovered Aramaic text (which he believes to have been the
basis of Theodotion's Greek) consists of the Dragon story only. The
notion that it had a separate currency is therefore, <a class="pagenum" title="200" id="page200"></a>to a certain
extent, supported; and this would still be the case, even if Gaster's
text is not an original, but a translation.</p>

<p>If Gaster's Aramaic were really the basis of &#920;'s version, it would
follow that he did not confine himself to making a mere recension of the
&#927;&#8189; text, though he evidently availed himself of it as far as he thought
proper. It is highly probable that this would apply to the Bel as well
as to the Dragon story, although the corresponding Aramaic of the former
is not at present forthcoming.</p>

<p>Neither the &#927;&#8189; nor &#920;'s original text seem to have been materially
tampered with, either in the way of addition or omission. Each has some
clauses not contained in the other: &#927;&#8189; in vv. 9, 15, 31, 39; &#920; in vv. 1,
12, 13, 36, 40. Yet Westcott (Smith's <i>D.B.</i> I. 397a, ed. 2, 714a)
thinks that some of &#920;'s changes arose from a desire to give consistency
to the facts. The change at the end of v. 27, however, is hardly a happy
one, <span xml:lang="el">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#949;&#7990;&#960;&#949;&#957;</span> being put immediately after <span xml:lang="el">&#8001; &#948;&#961;&#940;&#954;&#969;&#957;</span>, thus suggesting the
idea that the latter drew attention to the fact that he was destroyed.
The LXX. avoided this.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that Theodoret, in his <i>Commentary on Daniel</i>, comments
on vv. 1 and 2 of Bel <a class="pagenum" title="201" id="page201"></a>and the Dragon (&#920;) only, treating them as the
closing verse (14) of chap. xii., and introducing them with the words,
<span xml:lang="el">&#959;&#8021;&#964;&#969; &#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#974;&#963;&#945;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#940;&#955;&#965;&#968;&#953;&#957; &#7952;&#960;&#942;&#947;&#945;&#947;&#949;&#957; &#8001; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#942;&#964;&#951;&#962;&#903; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#8001; &#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#8058;&#962;
&#7944;&#963;&#964;&#965;&#940;&#947;&#951;&#962;, &#954;.&#964;.&#955;.</span> This curious fact, combined with that of their omission
from the &#927;&#8189;, points to some arrangement of the text with which we are
not acquainted. Theodoret also refers to these same verses previously,
in commenting on chaps. v. 3 and x. 1. Though he says nothing of the
rest of Bel and the Dragon, he shews, by his referring in Ep. cxlv.
(latter part) to Habakkuk's miraculous flight through the air, that he
was well acquainted with the story, and approved of it.</p>

<p>The principal MSS. available are A, B, Q, &#915; (vv. 2-4 only), and &#916; from
v. 21 to 41, which has recently reinforced our somewhat scanty uncial
authorities.</p>

<p>The text of A appears to have slightly better Greek (vv. 9, 10, 19, 21,
27); but the form <span xml:lang="el">&#956;&#945;&#967;&#945;&#943;&#961;&#951;&#962;</span> (occurs in Heb. xi. 34 in A), if not a
slip,<a id="fnt67" href="#fn67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> seems Ionic (Wordsworth's <i>Greek Gram.</i> &sect; 16, Obs.), as has
been already mentioned ('Authorship,' p. 193), and might perhaps be
accounted for by &#920;'s connection <a class="pagenum" title="202" id="page202"></a>with Ephesus. The substitution of <span xml:lang="el">&#960;&#961;&#972;&#962;</span>
for <span xml:lang="el">&#964;&#8183;</span>, however, in v. 34 seems no improvement, A in this, as in several
other instances (vv. 10, 28, 35), agreeing with the &#927;&#8189; reading. Taking,
for convenience, B as the norm, we find that A's departures from it are
somewhat larger than in the Song of the Three. In v. 7 <span xml:lang="el">&#959;&#8016;&#948;&#8050; &#960;&#941;&#960;&#969;&#954;&#949;&#957;
&#960;&#974;&#960;&#959;&#964;&#949;</span> is added, as also in Q, to the description of Bel's inability to
consume food. In v. 11 <span xml:lang="el">&#948;&#945;&#954;&#964;&#973;&#955;&#8179;</span> is curiously substituted by A for
<span xml:lang="el">&#948;&#945;&#954;&#964;&#965;&#955;&#943;&#8179;</span>; in v. 13 <span xml:lang="el">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#966;&#952;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#957;</span> for <span xml:lang="el">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#966;&#961;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#965;&#957;</span>. Both these are
suggestive of carelessness or of error <i xml:lang="la">ex ore dictantis</i> (Scrivener,
<i>N.T. Criticism</i>, ed. 2, p. 10). In v. 36 the substitution of <span xml:lang="el">&#967;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#972;&#962;</span> for
<span xml:lang="el">&#954;&#959;&#961;&#965;&#966;&#8134;&#962;</span> is peculiar. The alteration of gender in v. 17, &#963;&#8182;&#945;&#953; for <span xml:lang="el">&#963;&#8182;&#959;&#953;</span> in
its first occurrence, but not in its second, may come under the head of
those &quot;somewhat officious corrections&quot; with which the editors of I.
Macc. in the <i>Camb. Bible for Schools</i> (p. 48) charge this MS., as
likewise perhaps the reading <span xml:lang="el">&#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#943;&#969;&#957;</span> for <span xml:lang="el">&#964;&#941;&#954;&#957;&#969;&#957;</span> in v. 10.</p>

<div id="fn67" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt67">[67]</a> There is clearly a slip in v. 35 of
<span xml:lang="el">&#916;&#945;&#957;&#953;&#942;&#955;</span> for <span xml:lang="el">&#7944;&#956;&#946;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#973;&#956;</span>,
and
probably in v. 11 of <span xml:lang="el">&#948;&#945;&#954;&#964;&#973;&#955;&#8179;</span> for
<span xml:lang="el">&#948;&#945;&#954;&#965;&#955;&#943;&#8179;</span>, indicating some mistakes on
the scribe's part, or errors in his copy.</p>
</div>

<p>Q not unfrequently agrees with it in differing from B. It stands alone,
however, in reading <span xml:lang="el">&#957;&#945;&#8056;&#957;</span> for <span xml:lang="el">&#7985;&#949;&#961;&#972;&#957;</span> in v. 22, and in omitting the last
six words of v. 41, perhaps as improbable when coming from Cyrus.
Together with A, it contains an additional <a class="pagenum" title="203" id="page203"></a>clause in v. 24, putting
words into Cyrus' mouth which connect the two stories together. &#915;,
having vv. 2-4 only, contains no important variation. &#916; (only from v.
21 to v. 41) contains in v. 22 the curious word <span xml:lang="el">&#7956;&#947;&#948;&#959;&#956;&#945;</span> instead of
<span xml:lang="el">&#7956;&#954;&#948;&#959;&#964;&#959;&#957;</span>.</p>

<p>All things considered, the text of both versions may be said to be in as
fair condition as in the canonical part of Daniel.</p>

<p>[<i>See</i> corresponding title in <a href="#susanna">Susanna</a>.]</p>

<p>The indications of a Semitic original give this fragment, in that
respect, a middle place between the other two. Less numerous than in the
Song of the Three, they are more so than in the History of Susanna,
though this is a shorter piece than that.</p>

<p>The non-discovery by Origen and others of Hebrew originals in their own
day by no means goes so far as to prove that such never existed, as
Rothstein in Kautzsch (I. 179) truly says.</p>

<p>Since Gaster's discovery of an Aramaic text of the Dragon (not of Bel),
the probability of a Semitic rather than a Greek original seems
strengthened. But see what Sch&uuml;rer thinks, under the cor<a class="pagenum" title="204" id="page204"></a>responding
title in the Song of the Three, as also of the Syriac version at the end
of Neubauer's <i>Tobit.</i> C.H. Toy, too, in his article in the <i>Jewish
Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>, Vol. II, says: &quot;In the present state of knowledge it
seems better to reserve opinion as to its antiquity.&quot;</p>

<p>Delitzsch, at the end of his <i>Commentatio de Hab. proph. vita atque
&aelig;tate</i> (Lips. 1842), prints in Rabbinic characters a Persian rendering,
&quot;ex codice Paris-Reg. judaico-persico,&quot; which he says &quot;<span xml:lang="la">ex textu hebraico
vel aramaico factam esse, ex crebris hebraismis patet</span>&quot; (p. 105). And on
pp. 26, 27 he prints the LXX from v. 28 to the end, and adds: &quot;<span xml:lang="la">H&aelig;c omnia
ad verbum Hebraico vel Aramaico translata esse dictionis simplicitas,
structura ac tota indoles clamat atque testatur.</span>&quot; But on p. 41 he quotes
the opinion of Prof. Solomon Munk, of Paris (<i>Notice sur Rab. Saadia
Gaon</i>, p. 84), that this Hebrew text, translated into Persian, was
itself made by some European Rabbi from the Greek or Latin Bible. And a
similar origin for Gaster's text is now thought far from unlikely.</p>

<p>It may be well here to give a few brief notes on the separate phrases as
they occur:</p>

<p>v. 3 &#920;. With <span xml:lang="el">&#7952;&#948;&#945;&#960;&#945;&#957;&#8182;&#957;&#964;&#959;</span>, <i>cf.</i> <span xml:lang="he">&#1488;&#1458;&#1499;&#1463;&#1500;&#1462;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1523;</span> of <a class="pagenum" title="205" id="page205"></a>Deut. xxxii. 23 (&quot;I will

Greek, but apparently not with <span xml:lang="el">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</span>, nor yet in the canonical O.T.
Deissmann, however, attempts to shew that this use of <span xml:lang="el">&#949;&#7984;&#962;</span>, instead of
'dativus commodi,' is an Alexandrian idiom (<i>Bible Studies</i>, Eng. tr.,
Edinb. 1900, p. 127). <span xml:lang="he">&#1499;&#1500;&#1488;</span> is also used in Aramaic in the same sense in
Pahel.</p>

<p>v. 6 &#927;&#8189;. The same phrase as the last recurs, inverted: <span xml:lang="el">&#949;&#7984;&#962; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#8056;&#957;
&#948;&#945;&#960;&#945;&#957;&#8118;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span>.</p>

<p>v. 7 &#927;&#8189;. Here the accusative after <span xml:lang="el">&#8000;&#956;&#957;&#973;&#969;</span> might be taken as favouring a
Greek original, since <span xml:lang="el">&#7952;&#957;</span> for <span xml:lang="he">&#1489;</span> would seem natural in a translation of
Hebrew or Aramaic.</p>

<p>v. 7 &#920;; v. 11 &#927;&#8189;, &#920;; v. 27 &#927;&#8189;. The occurrence of <span xml:lang="el">&#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#949;&#8166;</span> in these verses
suggests a rendering of <span xml:lang="he">&#1502;&#1463;&#1500;&#1456;&#1489;&#1464;&#1468;&#1488;</span> which is used several times in the
Aramaic portion of Daniel, while it never occurs in the vocative in the
Hebrew portion. This indication, small though it be, inclines of course
towards an Aramaic rather than a Hebrew original.</p>

<p>v. 10 &#927;&#8189;, &#920;. Scholz's suggestion that <span xml:lang="el">&#967;&#969;&#961;&#943;&#962;</span> and <span xml:lang="el">&#7952;&#954;&#964;&#972;&#962;</span> are translations

a bad one. This is possibly a rendering of <span xml:lang="he">&#1492;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;</span> in the latter case, of
<span xml:lang="he">&#1492;&#1510;&#1500;&#1492;</span> in the former.</p>

<p>The Greek of the writer is hardly such as we should expect, unless he
was narrating a story which had reached him from a Hebrew source. The
frequency with which verbs occur very early in the construction of
sentences is a point in favour of a Semitic original, which does appear
to have been dwelt upon, <i>e.g.</i> vv. 11, 20 (&#927;&#8189;), and 14, 16, 22 (&#920;).</p>

<p>It is a matter of considerable nicety to estimate the value of these and
similar indications. They are not decisive. They tell with varying force
upon varying minds; but they distinctly tend, in the writer's opinion,
to increase the probability of the Greek having been grounded upon a
Hebrew or an Aramaic form of the story, the likelihood of the latter
being slightly the stronger.</p>

<p>In view of the introduction of Habakkuk into the story of the Dragon,
Delitzsch's opinion as to the <a class="pagenum" title="209" id="page209"></a>similarity of Daniel's Hebrew to the
Hebrew of that prophet (<i>see</i> Streane, <i>Age of Macc.</i> p. 262) becomes of
importance. A. Scholz, too, is of opinion (p. 146) that the Habakkuk
title makes for a Hebrew original, because the real prophecy of Habakkuk
was undoubtedly Hebrew, and this piece, whether genuine or fictitious,
would hardly have been appended in another language.</p>

<p>The LXX version was certainly known to Theodotion, since he copies much
of it, yet not quite so largely as in the Song of the Three. But it is
evident that he had other documents or traditions to use, of which he
freely availed himself; possibly some previous translation other than
LXX, as has been suggested under Susanna ('Date and Place,' p. 114).
There seems nothing in either Greek recension to imply that the two
parts of Bel and the Dragon (separated in Luther's version) are not by
the same hand.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that the word <span xml:lang="el">&#7956;&#954;&#948;&#959;&#964;&#959;&#957;</span>, applied to Bel when handed over
to Daniel (v. 22, &#920;), is used of our Lord in Acts ii. 23, these two
being its only Biblical occurrences.</p>

<h5>Style.</h5>

<p>The style is that of simple, clear, and well-told narrative, with very
little rhetorical embellishment <a class="pagenum" title="210" id="page210"></a>about it, yet bearing somewhat of a
dramatic cast, like much of the canonical book to which it is appended.
It is not tedious (though there is much to tell which might have been
easily spun out), but is brief and spirited. There is nothing
superfluous to the aim of the story.<a id="fnt69" href="#fn69"><sup>[69]</sup></a></p>

<div id="fn69" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt69">[69]</a> It is even given in L.C. Cope's <i>English Composition</i>
(Lond.,
1900), as an example of the four essentials of composition, viz.
invention, selection, disposition, diction. He also speaks (p. 29) of
the &quot;superb workmanship in framing the narrative.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>Moreover, the narrative is told in such a way as ever to be a story of
captivating interest to the young, being full of movement and
interesting incident. The style of the composition is much more in
accordance with Syrian than with Alexandrian models. There is nothing of
Hellenistic speculation or philosophy, though the subject of idolatry
would have lent itself to such treatment (as that of injustice would in
Susanna). No figurative or hyperbolic phraseology is employed.</p>

<p>An idea has been revived and maintained that the lions' den episode at
the end is a mere adaptation and embellishment of that in Dan. vi.<a id="fnt70" href="#fn70"><sup>[70]</sup></a>
(Churton, 392; Streane, 109, &quot;distortions of O.T. narratives&quot;; J.M.
Fuller, S.P.C.K. <i>Comm. in loc.</i>). This idea is <a class="pagenum" title="211" id="page211"></a>successfully opposed by
Arnald, who (on v. 31) gives three reasons against it, and by Bishop
Gray (<i>Introd. to O.T. in loc.</i>). Delitzsch (p. 30) calls this section
of &#920;'s version &quot;partem dignissimam.&quot; Attempts to prove the falsity of
this martyrdom, if such it may be called, by first assuming the identity
of these two events, treating the latter as an ornamental exaggeration
of the former, and then pointing out what are taken for irreconcileable
discrepancies, are beside the mark. Nor does the supposition that the
one night in the den (of Dan. vi.) was increased to six, nor that the
detail of withholding the lions' usual food to sharpen their appetites
(in &#920; only), were added for the purpose of heightening the effect, carry
much weight. The omission of Daniel's speech, with the detail<a id="fnt71" href="#fn71"><sup>[71]</sup></a> of the
angel closing the lions' mouths (vv. 21, 22), tells in the opposite
direction. It is no more necessary to reckon these two den episodes as
one event than our Lord's feeding of the four and five thousand, or his
healing of the centurion's servant and the nobleman's son.</p>

<h4>Religious And Social State.</h4>

<h5>Religious.</h5>

<p>A religious feeling, strong though misdirected, evidently existed both
in king and people, involving <a class="pagenum" title="212" id="page212"></a>considerable expenditure on objects and
places of worship. It was not as to the propriety of worship in itself,
but of the object towards which it ought to be directed, that the
controversy arose.</p>

<p>Two sorts of worship were in vogue:&mdash;</p>

<p>(a) <i>Bel-worship.</i> As to the practice of this in Babylon no question
appears to be raised; he was the supreme god and guardian of Babylon.
The representation of Cyrus as a worshipper of Bel agrees with the
account of himself in the Annals of Nabu-nahid, cited by Ball on v. 4;
and Sayce (<i>Temple Bible</i>, Tobit, p. 95) notes that the cuneiform
monuments have shewn that Cyrus was politic enough to conform to the
religion of his Babylonian subjects.</p>

<p>The unabashed effrontery of the idol-priests (vv. 11, 12) is very
characteristic. See, however, Blakesley's note on Herodot. VIII. 41.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Dragon-worship.</i> This is not otherwise known to have existed in
Babylonia, but snake-worship, which may be the same, is asserted by J.T.
Marshall (end of art. <i>Bel and the Dragon</i>, Hastings' <i>D.B.</i>.). In
support of this it is noteworthy that <span xml:lang="el">&#8001; &#948;&#961;&#940;&#954;&#969;&#957;</span> is identified with <span xml:lang="el">&#8001; &#8004;&#966;&#953;&#962;</span>
in Rev. xii. 9, and that <span xml:lang="he">&#1504;&#1464;&#1495;&#1464;&#1513;&#1473;</span> and <span xml:lang="he">&#1514;&#1463;&#1468;&#1504;&#1460;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;</span> seem identified in Ex. iv.
3 and vii. 9. A. Kamphausen, in the <i>Encycl. Bibl.</i>, thinks that
<a class="pagenum" title="213" id="page213"></a>&quot;G&uuml;nkel has conclusively shewn that the primeval Babylonian myth of the
conquest of the chaos-monster or the great dragon Tiamat by the god
Marduk lies at the root.&quot; So J.M. Fuller, in the S.P.C.K. <i>Comm.</i>, says
that &quot;in Babylonian inscriptions dealing with the fall, a dragon,
generally female, appears.&quot; Daniel plans his scheme in accordance with
the dragon's known voracity (Jer. li. 34). The <span xml:lang="el">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#949;&#954;&#973;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#945;&#957; &#964;&#8056;&#957; &#948;&#961;&#940;&#954;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;</span>
of Rev. xiii. 4 may have been suggested by the dragon-worship here;
<span xml:lang="el">&#7952;&#963;&#941;&#946;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#959;</span> is used in v. 23, <span xml:lang="el">&#960;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#954;&#973;&#957;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#957;</span> (with dat.) in v. 24 (both
versions).</p>

<p>Daniel set himself, in reply to the king, who suggested to him the
propriety of Bel-worship, to detach the Babylonians from these
superstitious follies, to interpret God's will in the matter, and to
free them from the service of idols. Yet his own name, 'Belteshazzar,'
may have implied<a id="fnt72" href="#fn72"><sup>[72]</sup></a> Bel's existence; still, even if it was so, we must
remember that it was not self-assumed, but given by the chief eunuch.
The king's question shews that he misunderstood Daniel's character. It
is noticeable, as a link of connection between the two parts of the
story, that Daniel attacks the former superstition, Bel, by disproving
the belief in the god's powers of eating; <a class="pagenum" title="214" id="page214"></a>and the latter, the Dragon,
by destroying the supposed divinity by means of what he ate.</p>

<div id="fn72" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt72">[72]</a> See note to 'For Whom and with What Object' p. 196.</p>
</div>

<p>As described in the Greek, Daniel's method of destroying the Dragon
appears quite inadequate to effect his purpose. The ingredients named as
composing the ball do not seem capable of achieving the result which
followed. But in Gaster's Aramaic a different light is thrown upon the
matter; for the ball is merely used as a vehicle to conceal sharp teeth
embedded in it, so that the Dragon might swallow them unawares, and
sustain internally a fatal laceration. If this be accepted as correct,
Sir Thomas Browne's discussion, as to how such unlikely ingredients
might bring about a death of the kind described, is naturally set aside.
S. Wilkin, however, in his edition of Browne's <i>Works</i>, 1835 (Vol. II.
p. 337), does not treat Sir T. Browne's discussion as a serious one; but
in this view all will not concur. Sch&uuml;rer, in Hauck's <i>Dict.</i> (I. 639),
writes of the Dragon as having been slain &quot;mit unverdaulichen Kitchen&quot;;
and Toy, in the <i>Jewish Encyclop&aelig;dia</i>, regards &quot;the iron comb insertion
as a natural embellishment.&quot; It is, however, not at all out of keeping
with Daniel's clever devices for the detection of error, and looks like
a practicable plan. And Josippon, quoted by Heppner, <i>op. cit.</i> p. 33,
gives a similar <a class="pagenum" title="215" id="page215"></a>account of the Dragon's destruction,
<span xml:lang="he">&#1493;&#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; &#1511;&#1512;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;&#1489;&#1512;&#1494;&#1500;</span>.</p>

<p>The consequence of the prophet's triumph in each case appears to have
been that the king was convinced of the vanity of idols much more than
his people. And as Daniel's demonstrations were not, so far as we see,
made before the general public, this is what might have been expected. A
similar conviction on Nebuchadnezzar's part, without any spontaneous
assent of his people, may be noticed in Dan. iii. 28-30, vi. 25-28. A
lack of popular adhesion to the king's change of mind would sufficiently
account for the early restoration of Bel's temple (<i>see</i> 'Chronology,'
p. 225).</p>

<p>In v. 21 the LXX states that it was Daniel who shewed the king the privy
doors. This, on the whole, has more <i>vraisemblance</i> than the idea of
Theodotion, who states that it was the priests who undertook the task.
Ball suggests that they did so because they were &quot;in fear of their
lives&quot;; but if so, this plan of saving them, by making a clean breast of
the matter, was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Another religious feature shews itself in v. 28, viz. the scorn in which
the Babylonian zealots held the Jewish religion. It would evidently have
been regarded as a degradation for the king to become a <a class="pagenum" title="216" id="page216"></a>Jew, and social
would probably here combine with religious grounds in giving force to
this feeling. Compare Pilate's contempt of such an idea with regard to
himself, as expressed in St. John xviii. 35. Grotius proposed a
translation which inverted the phrase in such a way as to make it apply
to Daniel: &quot;A Jew has become king.&quot; This, however, is not natural in the
Greek, has no countenance lent to it by the Aramaic text, and is clearly
opposed by the Syriac marginal title as given in Swete's manual LXX,
&quot;tit. adpinx. ut vid. <span xml:lang="el">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#953; &#964;&#959;&#965; &#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#969;&#962; &#955;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#953; &#969;&#962; &#947;&#949;&#947;&#959;&#957;&#949;&#957; &#921;&#959;&#965;&#948;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>,
Syr<sup>mg</sup>.&quot; Cajetanus Bugati also (<i>Daniel</i>, Milan, 1788, p. 162) thinks
Grotius wrong.<a id="fnt73" href="#fn73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> For a similarly imagined instance of a king embracing
Judaism, <i>cf.</i> II. Macc. ix. 17, headed by A.V., &quot;Antiochus promiseth to
become a Jew,&quot; on which Rawlinson notes, &quot;it is extremely improbable
that Epiphanes ever expressed any such intention,&quot; an opinion in which
most will agree.</p>

<div id="fn73" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt73">[73]</a> Compare the Aramaic of the passage, given under 'Chronology,' p.
229.</p>
</div>

<p>The withholding of food, in order to sharpen the lions' appetites (v.
32), shews a spirit similar to that which directed the sevenfold heating
of the furnace in chap. iii. The numbers in vv. 2, 10, etc., are quite
in keeping with Daniel's use of symbolic <a class="pagenum" title="217" id="page217"></a>numeration for purposes of
religious teaching; and the zeal displayed against idolatry is
characteristic of the Jewish captivity, as depicted in the canonical
book which bears his name. These three points, therefore, so far as they
go, tell in favour of the religious unity of the whole.</p>

<h5>Social.</h5>

<p>Daniel appears on the same terms of intimacy with royalty as in the
canonical book, and speaks his mind a little more freely and intimately
perhaps, as becomes his added years and experience. He still acts as a
divine messenger to a heathen king, and he successfully unmasks his
fallacy of judging by appearances in the matter of Bel's food. His
laughter in vv. 7,19, may have been amusement at the king's simplicity
or at the priests' cunning, the king's wrath in vv. 8, 21, being
compatible with either. But this laughter of v. 7 only appears in &#920;'s
version. As in Susanna, he stands as the willing exposer of fraud,
intellectually acute as well as morally upright.</p>

<p>v. 29 &#920; has been objected to by Ball and by Z&ouml;ckler as an unlikely mode
of address by the conquered Babylonians to Cyrus their conqueror.
Probably some tumultous rising took place, which the king, a true
oriental monarch, pacified at the expense <a class="pagenum" title="218" id="page218"></a>of Daniel. On such outbreaks
courtly politeness often vanishes, and the tyrant is subject to tyranny.
Such an occurrence agrees with Habakkuk's description of the Chaldees as
&quot;bitter and hasty&quot; (i. 6), and 'senseless' and 'absurd' are scarcely the
terms to apply to it.</p>

<p>The slaughter of the priests (vv. 22, 28) is quite in accordance with
the practice as shewn in the canonical chapters ii. and vi.<a id="fnt74" href="#fn74"><sup>[74]</sup></a>; also
the destruction of false accusers (v. 42) with vi. 25; so also the
keeping of lions by the king; and so, too, the method of double sealing
(v. 11 &#927;&#8189;, 14 &#920;; vi. 17). That <span xml:lang="el">&#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#940;&#961;&#953;&#945;</span> should be under the command of
Daniel (v. 14 &#920; and Syr.) is what would be likely for one in his
position. The term is used of himself in Sus. 45 &#920; as a page of superior
rank. The idea of an image being made of more materials than one (v. 7)
is paralleled in ii. 32, 33.</p>

ideas of justice, <i>see</i> Mozley, <i>Ruling O.T. Ideas</i>, 1878, pp. 88, 95,

<p>Cyrus' cowardice in giving up Daniel to the threatening mob is very like
Pilate's in delivering up Christ (St. Matt, xxvii. 26, St. John xix.
16). <span xml:lang="el">&#928;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#948;&#943;&#948;&#969;&#956;&#953;</span> is used in each case (v. 29 &#920;, 30 &#920; and &#927;&#8189;). Similar,
too, is Nebuchadnezzar's conduct with Daniel, and that of Herod Antipas
with St. John <a class="pagenum" title="219" id="page219"></a>Baptist. Despotic rulers are often frightened by popular
clamour. But Cyrus, however weak in yielding, appears at the close of
the story in a less odious light than Pilate.</p>

<p>As in Susanna, there is no indication of rabbinism in the legal,
religious, or social standpoints of the story.</p>
</div>

<div id="part4_8" class="section">
<h4>Theology.</h4>

<p>The whole piece makes a mock at idolatry<a id="fnt75" href="#fn75"><sup>[75]</sup></a> with a view of turning men
from false worships to that of the living God. Indeed the end of v. 5
seems an echo of Gen. i. 1. Jehovah's power to vindicate Himself and His
servants is of course also exhibited, and this in contrast to the idols,
who make no resistance to their overthrow.</p>

<div id="fn75" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt75">[75]</a> &quot;More withering sarcasm could scarcely be poured on
heathenism than
in the apocryphal story of Bel and the Dragon&quot; (Edersheim, <i>Life and
Times of Messiah</i>, 1886, I. 31). Daniel's laugh in v. 7 accords with
Jeremiah's view of idols (X. 15). Other coincidences with Jeremiah may
be noted in 1. 2, li. 44 of that prophet.</p>
</div>

<p>He is represented as Sole Sovereign, the only God worthy of worship,
with full power to deliver by wonderful providence His faithful people,
who make their acknowledgments to Him. However far they may be
scattered, His eye is still upon them; He forsakes not those who seek
and love Him (v. 38).</p>

<p>vv. 3, 4, 14 are quoted by Iren&aelig;us (IV. ix. 1) <a class="pagenum" title="220" id="page220"></a>to prove that the one
living God was the God worshipped by the prophets, as &quot;the God of the
living.&quot; Even the heathen king is forced to confess that He is great and
unique, and (in Vulg. only, v. 42) calls Him Saviour, and desires the
whole world to worship Him.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that the king is represented as the party complaining
in the first instance; it is his question (v. 4) which draws forth from
Daniel his practical proof of the vanity of idols, inanimate or animate,
culminating in the triumphant exclamation at the end of v. 27. And thus
the imposture of idol-worship is revealed, as well as the value of
devotion to the true Lord of all, by a process commenced in the opposite
interest.</p>

<p>Daniel resists the king's invitation to worship Bel, which might have
led him under the ban of Deut. xviii. 20 (end) as &quot;speaking in the name
of other gods.&quot; False theological opinions are corrected by Daniel, who
not only dissuades from idol-worship, but persuades to that of the true
deity. Hence the beautiful appropriateness of <span xml:lang="el">&#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#7936;&#947;&#945;&#960;&#8182;&#957;&#964;&#940;&#962; &#963;&#949;</span> (v. 38)
instead of <span xml:lang="el">&#964;&#959;&#8058;&#962; &#7952;&#955;&#960;&#943;&#950;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;&#962; &#7952;&#960;&#8125; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#972;&#957;</span> in the corresponding point of
delivery in Sus. 60 &#920;. For Daniel was fighting for God, while Susanna
was defending herself. The one was an active plaintiff for God, <a class="pagenum" title="221" id="page221"></a>the
other a passive defendant of herself. Thus Love in Daniel's case, Hope
in Susanna's, has its own special appropriateness.</p>

<p>In v. 5 Daniel claims God to be <span xml:lang="el">&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#950;&#8182;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#952;&#949;&#972;&#957;</span>, but Cyrus claims for Bel
to be only <span xml:lang="el">&#950;&#8182;&#957; &#952;&#949;&#972;&#962;</span>; in v. 24 Cyrus makes the same claim for the Dragon,
and then in v. 25 Daniel makes only a like claim for God (anarthrous),
for Daniel takes here the words out of Cyrus' mouth; in the former
instance it was <i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. The same phrases are used by Darius in vi.
20, 26 &#920;. Thus the prophet makes a more exclusive claim for the divinity
of his God. In v. 6 a contrast is afforded with what is said of God in
Ps. xvi. 2 (P.B. aft. Vulg. and LXX), as the Creator who still retains
power over living beings.</p>

<p>As in the canonical Dan. vi. 22 (and in the other additions thereto), so
here an angel intervenes on behalf of the right, rescuing God's
persecuted prophet. A man is employed in each case also to carry out the
miraculous purposes of God. Further, compare the angel helping Daniel,
after conflict with the Dragon, with Rev. xii. 7, 8.</p>

<p>The sudden transportation of Habakkuk (v. 36) is parallelled by that of
St. Philip in Acts viii. 39 by the &quot;Spirit of the Lord.&quot; Ezek. viii. 3,
which is printed as a parallel in the margin of A.V. at <a class="pagenum" title="222" id="page222"></a>iii. 12, 14 of
that book, may also be compared,<a id="fnt76" href="#fn76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> as well as I. Kings xviii. 12 and
St. Matt. iv. I. For the latter part of this verse (36), barely
intelligible in the Greek, Gaster's Aramaic gives an excellent sense.</p>

<div id="fn76" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt76">[76]</a> Ezekiel is transported in the opposite direction, and
both prophets
went unwillingly (Trapp). Both, too, were concerned in suppression of
idolatry.</p>
</div>

<p>There does not seem to be any undue love of the marvellous or straining
to bring it into prominence. Both the statue and the Dragon are
destroyed by ordinary means; and their false position in the imagination
of the people is unmasked without any resort to the miraculous.<a id="fnt77" href="#fn77"><sup>[77]</sup></a> This
element does not enter into the story till the rescue of the persecuted
Daniel, who has been so zealous for the honour of his God.</p>

<div id="fn77" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt77">[77]</a> The destruction of the Dragon, by means which in A.V. and the
Greek
appear inadequate, does not come under this head, since the Aramaic
explains it by iron teeth concealed in the ball (v. 27), an intelligible
and practical device.</p>
</div>

<p>Though, with its two companion pieces, it has been cavilled at (not to
reckon Africanus' enquiries) from the time of the Jewish teacher whom
Jerome tells us of in his preface to Daniel, yet even the most
contemptuous deprecators of the 'Additions' can find little seriously to
condemn in the theology <a class="pagenum" title="223" id="page223"></a>of this story.<a id="fnt78" href="#fn78"><sup>[78]</sup></a> Considering the strong
desire which has existed in some quarters to charge these apocryphal
books with grievous doctrinal error, this fact says much. The knowledge
of God and of divine things is what would be probable at the time it
represents, and is not incongruous with the book to which it is
appended, nor with its fellow-appendices. This speaks well for its
excellence and its consistency.</p>

<div id="fn78" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt78">[78]</a> Of general condemnations, Alb. Barnes' may be taken as a sample:
&quot;This foolish story... is wholly unworthy a place in any volume claiming
Divine origin, or any volume of respectable authorship whatever&quot;
(<i>Comment. on Dan.</i> Vol. I. pp. 79, 81).</p>
</div>

</div>

<div id="part4_9" class="section">
<h4>Chronology.</h4>

<p>The principal chronological points, concerning which difficulties have
been felt, arise: (A) in vv. 1, 2, concerning Astyages, Cyrus, and
Daniel; (B) in v. 22, as to the destruction of Bel's temple; and (C) in
v. 33, as to Habakkuk being a contemporary of Daniel.</p>

<p>In connection with A, it is remarkable that v. 1 forms in the Vulgate
the last verse of the preceding chapter, <i>i.e.</i> the last verse of
Susanna. This arrangement may have been made from chronological reasons,
possibly to escape an apparent difficulty; and in the LXX the verse is
wanting altogether. Either plan, the attachment of the verse to
<a class="pagenum" title="224" id="page224"></a>Susanna, or its entire omission, has the effect of leaving the king in
this piece nameless, and so solves the imagined difficulty of Cyrus and
Daniel acting together as represented.</p>

<p>The text commented on by Theodoret offers the same solution in another
form, viz. by transferring v. 1 to the end of chap, xii., and so
concluding the book. He thus introduces it: <span xml:lang="el">&#927;&#8021;&#964;&#969; &#960;&#955;&#951;&#961;&#974;&#963;&#945;&#962; &#964;&#8052;&#957; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#940;&#955;&#965;&#968;&#953;&#957;
&#7952;&#960;&#942;&#947;&#945;&#947;&#949;&#957; &#8001; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#942;&#964;&#951;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#8001; &#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#8058;&#962; &#7944;&#963;&#964;&#965;&#940;&#947;&#951;&#962;, &#954;.&#964;.&#955;.</span> Theodoret comments
no further on Bel and the Dragon, though his remarks in other parts of
the commentary shew that he favourably regarded it. See his observations
on v. 31, x. 1.</p>

<p>The disappearance in one case, and the displacements in the others of
this verse, evidently point to some uncertainty in early times as to its
right connection. But the difficulties raised as to this verse even
where it stands are not so serious as was once thought. As Ball says <i>in
loc.</i>, &quot;The cuneiform records have thrown unexpected light on
difficulties which were the despair of bygone generations of scholars,&quot;
and quotes one which makes Astyages the captive of Cyrus. J.H. Blunt
attempts to shew, not very satisfactorily, that the king of v. 2 was
Darius. A note in Husenbeth's Douay version, still less so, quietly says
&quot;Astyages, or Darius&quot;!</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="225" id="page225"></a>It has also been suggested, with regard to this and difficulty C, that
another Daniel is here intended, to be identified with the Daniel of
Ezra viii. 2 (Bissell).</p>

<p>The second difficulty, B, is raised by the asserted destruction of Bel's
temple in v. 22. Now this is said not to have been destroyed till
Xerxes' return from Greece in 479. Even then Herodotus (I. 183) merely
says that he 'took' (<span xml:lang="el">&#7956;&#955;&#945;&#946;&#949;</span>) a golden statue, and slew the protesting
priest; Strabo, on hearsay, (XVI. 1) and Arrian (<i>Exp. Alex.</i> VII. 17),
however, assert its destruction. But this forms a small obstacle, unduly
magnified. Supposing Bel's temple to have been destroyed, as v. 22
narrates, it is far from improbable that another temple may have been
raised before Xerxes' arrival. The people were evidently attached to
Bel's worship, as v. 28 shews, notwithstanding the conviction of their
king as to the truth of Daniel's God. It is noticeable that the LXX has
no mention of the temple's, but only of the idol's, destruction; and
that &#920;, according to the manuscript Q, has not <span xml:lang="el">&#7985;&#949;&#961;&#972;&#957;</span> but <span xml:lang="el">&#957;&#945;&#972;&#957;</span> in v. 22.</p>

<p>A. Scholz entertains the strange opinion that this and other historic
difficulties were purposely introduced by the writer: &quot;<span xml:lang="de">Der Verfasser
unserer Erz&auml;hlung kennt sichtlich die Verh&auml;ltnisse in Baby<a class="pagenum" title="226" id="page226"></a>lon, und hat
seine Darstellung so eingerichtet, dass es einfach unm&ouml;glich ist, sie
geschichtlich zu verstehen</span>&quot; (p. 219). But this is a desperate expedient
to support his view of the whole story being intended for a 'vision,'
and it would be hard to find any parallel to such a proceeding on the
part of the sacred writers.<a id="fnt79" href="#fn79"><sup>[79]</sup></a></p>

<div id="fn79" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt79">[79]</a> The phrase applied to the Additions in the <i>Introd. to
Daniel</i> in
the <i>Speaker's Comm.</i> (p. 216a), <span xml:lang="he">&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;
&#1508;&#1497;&#1493;&#1496;&#1497;&#1503;</span> if we take <span xml:lang="he">&#1508;&#1497;&#1493;&#1496;</span> to mean
'poet,' would fall in with this view. J.M. Fuller does not make quite
clear his source for this phrase.</p>
</div>

<p>So far as Babylon is concerned, there is no indication of anything but a
time of peace, which is quite in accordance with the supposed period of
the narrative.</p>

<p>There is perhaps more difficulty, C, in making Habakkuk than in making
Cyrus, a contemporary of the grown-up Daniel. Indeed, with the earlier
date formerly assigned to Habakkuk, the difficulty seemed all but
insuperable, except by postulating two Habakkuks or two Daniels. And,
much as it may lack <i>vraisemblance</i>, either of those suppositions is of
course within the bounds of possibility. So Trapp notes, rather
sneeringly, on Hab. i. 1: &quot;Those apocryphal Additions to Daniel, which
either are false, or there were two Habakkuks&quot;; and J.H. Blunt, more
seriously, to a similar effect on Hab. i. 1 <a class="pagenum" title="227" id="page227"></a>and Bel 33. Josippon ben
Gorion (I. 7) joins the whole story with the canonical history, but, as
given by Delitzsch (<i>op. cit.</i> p. 40), transposes, presumably from
chronological motives, the den incident to the beginning of the story,
&quot;<span xml:lang="la">in ordine chronologico iudaic&aelig; traditioni de Habacuci &aelig;tate se
accommodantem.</span>&quot; Josippon, around whom considerable obscurity hangs, is
dated as of the eighth or ninth century in the <i>Biog. Univ.</i> art.
<i>Gorionides</i>, Paris, 1857; but in Hastings' <i>D.B.</i> art <i>Bel and the
Dragon</i>, p. 267b, c. A.D. 940 is given as his time.</p>

<p>Habakkuk's prophecy is now dated as late as 600 (Driver in Hastings'
<i>D.B.</i> art. <i>Habakkuk</i>; Kirkpatrick in Smith's <i>D.B<sup>2</sup>.</i> art. <i>Habakkuk</i>,
1256b, says &quot;not later than the sixth year of Jehoiakim&quot;); and if
Habakkuk prophesied in his youth, our story is not an impossible one. So
Cornelius Jansen (<i>Analecta</i>, p. 154), &quot;<span xml:lang="la">Quapropter nihil obstabit quo
minus idem Habacuc iam senex prandium in Babylonem detulerit</span>,&quot; and he
quotes a tradition of Isidore Hispalensis (<i>de vit. Proph.</i>) that
Habakkuk lived to see the return from the Captivity, and two years
after. Rosenm&uuml;ller, quoted in a note on Hab. i. 1 by Maurer (neither of
whom were too partial to traditional views), thinks that the time of
Habakkuk is consistent with the &quot;<span xml:lang="la">vetus fama in apocryphis <a class="pagenum" title="228" id="page228"></a>Danielis
additamentis</span>.&quot; He even places chap. iii. of Habakkuk under Zedekiah,
though with this Maurer does not agree (<i>cf.</i> Henderson, <i>Min. Proph.,
Introd. to Hab.</i>).</p>

<p>Jamieson, Brown, and Faussett in their Commentary, <i>Introd. to Hab.</i>
(1869), by no means inclined to favour the Apocrypha, say that Bel and
the Dragon agrees with the notion of Habakkuk prophesying in Jehoiakim's
reign.</p>

<p>G.A. Smith, however, in his <i>Book of the Twelve Prophets</i>, 1900, II.
130, contents himself with calling it &quot;an extraordinary story of
Habakkuk's miraculous carriage of food to Daniel in the lions' den, soon
after Cyrus had taken Babylon.&quot; But A.C. Jennings, in Bishop Ellicott's
<i>Comm. for English Readers, Introd. to Hab.</i>, pp. 523-5, says: &quot;The
story, worthless in itself, nevertheless, indirectly confirms the theory
of date which we have accepted below&quot; in these words, &quot;Habakkuk's
prophecy dates from the reign of Jehoiakim, not more than five years at
most before the battle of Carchemish&mdash;how much nearer that great event
it is impossible to say.&quot; Dean Farrar also curiously observes,
&quot;Habakkuk's appearance in apocryphal legend (vv. 33-39) shews the
impression he had made on the mind of his people, and perhaps indicates
his date as a contemporary of Daniel.&quot; <a class="pagenum" title="229" id="page229"></a>(<i>Minor Prophets</i> in 'Men of the
Bible' series, n.d., p. 160).</p>

<p>Another instance of belief in the contemporaneity of Daniel and Habakkuk
is afforded by Raymund Martini (<i>c.</i> 1250) in his <i>Pugio fidei</i> (Paris,
1651, p. 740): &quot;<span xml:lang="la">Habacuc vero Prophetam fuisse contemporaneum Danieli
inde colligitur ubi in Bereschit Rabba hoc modo scribitur de Joseph</span>,&quot; he
says before quoting a long passage from the B.R. on Gen. xxxvii. 24.
This passage is none other than a portion of Bel and the Dragon in
Chaldee, and is headed without reserve as <span xml:lang="he">&#1489;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1488;&#1500;</span>. It proceeds with v. 28
to the end:
<span xml:lang="he">&#1500;&#1499;&#1488; &#1500;&#1489;&#1497;&#1500; &#1514;&#1489;&#1491; &#1493;&#1500;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497;&#1504;&#1488; &#1511;&#1496;&#1500; &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492;&#1508;&#1499;&#1493; &#1510;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1503; &#1495;&#1491; &#1500;&#1495;&#1491; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1488;&#1492; &#1492;&#1493;&#1488; &#1500;&#1497;&#1492; &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1499;&#1504;&#1513;&#1493; &#1489;&#1489;&#1500;&#1488;&#1497; &#1510;&#1500; &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1488;</span>. Then follows a Latin translation,
after which Martini adds &quot;Hucusque traditio,&quot; and, after quoting Hab. i.
6, finishes his work.</p>

<p>Martini's good faith in quotation is defended by Neubauer in his Chaldee
Tobit (Oxf, 1888, xviii. to xxiv.). He also identifies the Breshith
Rabbah quoted with the Midrash Rabbah de Rabbah. The real Breshith is
probably as early as the 4th century; but neither in the Venice edition
of 1566, nor the Leipzig one of 1864, is the passage to be found under
Gen. xxxvii. <i>Cf.</i> Payne-Smith's note, as to Martini's <a class="pagenum" title="230" id="page230"></a>quotations, in
<i>Pearson on the Creed</i>, Oxf. 1870, p. 306, where it is shewn that by
Breshith Rabbah the book by Moses Haddarshan (of the 11th century) is
sometimes meant. Etheridge states that only fragments of this book are
extant (p. 406). Delitzsch (<i>de Habacuci Proph. vita atque &aelig;tate</i>, Lips.
1842, p. 34) also defends Martini's sincerity, and says &quot;<span xml:lang="la">Non dubito
fore, ut fragmentum a Raymundo nobiscum communicatum aliquando in
antiquis Genesis Rabba Codd., qui sane rarissimi sunt, inveniatur.</span>&quot;</p>

<p>The fact incidentally brought out in the story that Habakkuk was not
engaged in reaping, but was occupied in taking out food for the reapers,
fits in well with the idea of his advanced age. Such a task might well
be undertaken by one who was no longer strong enough for field
labour.<a id="fnt80" href="#fn80"><sup>[80]</sup></a></p>

<div id="fn80" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt80">[80]</a> Sozomen, <i>H.E.</i> vii. 29, says that Habakkuk's tomb was found
at
Keilah, <span xml:lang="el">&#954;&#949;&#955;&#8048;, &#7969; &#960;&#961;&#8054;&#957;
&#954;&#949;&#943;&#955;&#945;... &#954;&#945;&#952;&#8125; &#7969;&#957; &#8001;
&#7944;&#946;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#8058;&#956;</span> (<i>sic</i>)
<span xml:lang="el">&#949;&#8017;&#961;&#941;&#952;&#951;</span>. Now
Keilah is mentioned in I Sam. xxiii. 1 as having threshing-floors worth
robbing, and so presumably lay in a corn-growing district.</p>
</div>

<p>All these difficulties would, on other grounds, be deprived of much of
their importance by the theory of A. Scholz, if that could be accepted
as true. He regards the entire book of Daniel, including of course the
Additions, as a series of apocalyptic visions (p. 201). This he
considers as the earliest explanation, <a class="pagenum" title="231" id="page231"></a>supported by the heading <span xml:lang="el">&#8005;&#961;&#945;&#953;&#962;</span>
to each chapter of Daniel in A and some other MSS. But while removing
one set of difficulties, this theory introduces others of a character at
least as serious; and it is by no means easy to convince oneself that
there is an &quot;apocalyptic&quot; tone about this or the other Additions. This
remarkable theory cuts, rather than unties, such knots as are above
noted, and carries with it to most minds a strange and improbable air.</p>
</div>

<div id="part4_10" class="section">
<h4>Canonicity.</h4>

<p>What is said as to Susanna on this point holds almost entirely good
here. Both pieces have been called in question on nearly the same
ground, and have stood or fallen together. Possibly this one presents
rather more difficulty in some of its details.</p>

<p>It is often included in Scripture lists under the title Daniel;<a id="fnt81" href="#fn81"><sup>[81]</sup></a> and
is often quoted in the same manner, <i>e.g.</i> by St. Cyprian, <i>ad
Fortunatum</i>, &sect; 11, &quot;<span xml:lang="la">Daniel, Deo devotus &amp; sancto spiritu plenus exclamat
et dicit</span>,&quot; v. 4. The quotations given under 'Early Christian Literature
and Art' will shew how <a class="pagenum" title="232" id="page232"></a>strong a hold this story had in many quarters,
and what use was made of it.</p>

<div id="fn81" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt81">[81]</a> Delitzech thought it likely, though not certain, that the
<span xml:lang="el">&#946;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#943;&#945;</span>
mentioned by Josephus (<i>Ant.</i> x. 11. 7) as left by Daniel refer to the
Additions as portions of the canonical hook (<i>De Hab. vita</i>, etc., Lips.
1842, p. 25).</p>
</div>

<p>Pseudo-Athanasius, in his <i>Synops. S.S.</i>, mentions the story at the end
of Section 41 as included in Daniel, but he does <i>not</i> name it at the
close of the <i>Synopsis</i> as being outside the canonical books, as he does
in the case of Susanna. The writer of <i>De Mirabilibus Script. Sacr.</i>,
often attached to St. Augustine's works (Migne, <i>Patr. lat.</i> XXXV.;
Benedict, ed. appx. to Vol. III.), expressly declares against its
canonicity. This treatise is thought to have been composed in England or
Ireland in the 7th or 8th century (Loisy, <i>O.T.</i> p. 154).</p>

<p>The hesitation of the earlier Church, however, found no counterpart in
the canonizing decree of the Council of Trent; while, on the other hand,
Protestant opinion has run almost entirely against canonicity.
Diametrically opposite views are steadily maintained by authorities on
both sides; although among English-speaking Protestants there is perhaps
a decrease in the contempt with which this story was once treated.</p>

<p>Among the Syriac-using Christians of the Malabar coast, Bel and the
Dragon, with the other additions, is reckoned as &quot;part and parcel of the
book of Daniel&quot; (Letter to present writer of Aug. 8, <a class="pagenum" title="233" id="page233"></a>1902, from Rev.
F.V.J. Givargese, Principal of Mar Dionysius Seminary, Kottayam).
Bar-Hebr&aelig;us, too, comments on it, but says at the head of his remarks
that &quot;some do not receive this story&quot; (<i>op. cit.</i> p. 27).</p>

<p>The many, resemblances and coincidences between this and the canonical
book pointed out under other heads ('Language and Style,' 'Religious and
Social State,' etc.) of course tell, so far as they go, in its favour.</p>

<p>Schrader (Schenkel's <i>Bibel Lex.</i> 1869, art. <i>Habak.</i> p. 556) classes
Bel and the Dragon with pseudo-Epiphanius' and Rabbinic legends of the
same tale, as &quot;<span xml:lang="de">reine Fabeln und Legenden zu erkennen</span>.&quot; This seems too
positive an opinion of their untrustworthiness. It is agreed with,
however, by Orelli (<i>Introd.to Hab.</i>, Clarke's Transl.), who styles Bel
and the Dragon, or at least the Habakkuk incident in it, &quot;an idle
story.&quot; A.B. Davidson also (<i>Encyclop. Brit.</i> ed. 9, II. 181) writes of
it as being &quot;completely fabulous;&quot; and Ewald speaks of the episode of
Habakkuk as an example of an unhistoric spirit, growing rapidly and
dangerously (v. 487).</p>

<p>Cloquet's plea that non-canonicity is 'proved' (<i>XXXIX Arts.</i> 1885, pp.
112, 113) by six days being named here, and one day in the canonical
book, as the length of Daniel's incarceration in the den, is <a class="pagenum" title="234" id="page234"></a>beside the
mark. It assumes for controversial purposes that the two passages must
refer to the same event. This writer also speaks generally (p. 115) of
Bel and the Dragon's &quot;direct contradictions of Scripture.&quot; Such
strictures are only worth noticing as specimens of many instances in
which <i>possible</i> discrepancies between canonical and uncanonical books
are treated by a particular class of writers as <i>certain</i>, in the hope
of depreciating the latter. These are sometimes attacked with extreme
violence as full of fables, superstitions, and impieties&mdash;apocryphal in
the worst sense. But they deserve to be saved from this unmerited
contempt, indulged in usually for polemical purposes, and only rendered
possible by an insufficient study of the works themselves and the many
admirable points which they contain.</p>

<p>Our own Church indulges in no rash or sweeping assertions, but follows
the golden mean. She states in Art. VI. her present practical view of
this and the other Additions in common with the rest of the Apocrypha.
While not making any special doctrine to turn upon an apocryphal text,
she directs the perusal of this, with the other books of its class, for
purposes of practical edification. In singularly guarded and cautious
terms she is careful not to commit herself to anything more than a
statement <a class="pagenum" title="235" id="page235"></a>of her authorized practice. Thus she has not closed the door,
as the Council of Trent is supposed to have done,<a id="fnt82" href="#fn82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> against the entry
of fresh knowledge, with its corresponding changes of view or
modifications of usage.</p>

<h4>Early Christian Literature And Art</h4>

<h5>Literature.</h5>

<p>The following examples from primitive Christian writings bear more or
less directly upon this book.</p>

<p>NEW TESTAMENT. Compare B.V.M.'s words in St. Luke i. 38 with Daniel's at
the end of v. 9, &#920;. With John xviii. 35 compare Bel 38, &#927;&#8189; and &#920;, as to
a Gentile being taken for a Jew. Moreover the phrase <span xml:lang="el">&#964;&#8048; &#963;&#949;&#946;&#940;&#963;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#8017;&#956;&#8182;&#957;</span>
in Acts xvii. 23 is very like a reminiscence of Bel 27, &#920;, end. But A.
Scholz's idea that our Lord's words in John x. 9 are based on vv. 3, 6,
13 has little likelihood: &quot;<span xml:lang="de">gegens&auml;tzlich so nahe verwandt, dass in den
Evan<a class="pagenum" title="236" id="page236"></a>gelium darauf Bezug genommen sein k&ouml;nnte</span>&quot; (note on v. 13).</p>

<p>IREN&AElig;US (&#8224;200) in IV. ix. 1 quotes vv. 4, 5, 24, as coming from Daniel,
apparently without the smallest misgiving. His quotations accord with &#920;
as against &#927;&#8189;, v. 4 being the same in both. As Sch&uuml;rer says in Hauck's
<i>Encyclop&aelig;dia</i> (I. 640): &quot;<span xml:lang="de">Iren&auml;us benuzt die Uebersetzung des Theodotion
und so alle Folgenden</span>.&quot; But see under <i>Cyprian</i>.</p>

<p>CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA (&#8224;220) refers, <i>Strom.</i> I. 21 (middle, ed. Potter,
Oxf. 1715), among a chain of historic events, to the closing scene in
this piece: <span xml:lang="el">&#964;&#972;&#964;&#949; &#948;&#953;&#8048; &#948;&#961;&#940;&#954;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#916;&#945;&#957;&#953;&#8052;&#955; &#949;&#7984;&#962; &#955;&#940;&#954;&#954;&#959;&#957; &#955;&#949;&#972;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957; &#946;&#955;&#951;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#962;, &#8017;&#960;&#8056;

<p>TERTULLIAN (&#8224;240). In <i>de Jejun.</i> VII. (end) reference is made to vv.
35-39; and in IX. the story is again mentioned. In <i>de Oratione</i>, 29,
he quotes vv. 33, 34, seemingly with full acceptance. In <i>de Idol.</i> XIX.
he says that &quot;<span xml:lang="la">Daniel nec Belum nec draconem colere</span>.&quot;</p>

<p>ORIGEN (&#8224;254). Besides the question dealt with in his controversy with
Julius Africanus, Origen in the Fragment of his <i>Strom</i>, bk. X. expounds
Bel. He also quotes it in his <i>Exhort, ad martyrium</i>, &sect; 33.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="237" id="page237"></a>CYPRIAN (&#8224;258) in <i>ad Fortunatum</i>, 11, quotes v. 5, apparently
following a translation of the &#927;&#8189;, and not of &#920;'s, text. The same verse
is again quoted by him in <i>Ep.</i> lviii. 5 in exactly the same words. It
is curious that both passages are preceded, in the same sections, by a
quotation of Dan. iii. 16-18, apparently based on &#920;'s version. In the
case of v. 5 in <i>Ep.</i> lviii. there is a slight variation in the readings
of some MSS. as given by Hartel. <i>Cf.</i> Prof. Swete's <i>Introd.</i> 1902, p.
47.</p>

<p>PSEUDO-CYPRIAN (3rd century?) gives parts of vv. 37, 38, in <i>Oratio</i> II.
2, following &#927;&#8189; a little more closely than &#920;.</p>

<p>PASSING OF MARY (3rd or 4th century, <i>see D.C.B., Mary</i>, 1142b). In
the First Latin form vv. 33-39 are clearly referred to.</p>

<p>ATHANASIUS (&#8224;373) in his <i>Discourse against Arians</i>, II. 8, quotes v. 5
as words of Daniel, which he also refers to in III. 30.</p>

<p>EPHREM SYRUS (&#8224;378). In the hymn <i>de Jejunio</i> there is, according to
T.J. Lamy (Mechlin, 1886), a reference to Bel and the Dragon, &quot;<span xml:lang="la">cum
Daniel jejunavit</span>.&quot;</p>

<p>GREGORY NAZIANZEN (&#8224;390) in his poetical <i>Pr&aelig;cepta ad Virgines</i> has the
line, speaking of Daniel, <span xml:lang="el">&#7936;&#949;&#961;&#943;&#951;&#957; &#948;&#8125; &#7952;&#957;&#8054; &#967;&#961;&#963;&#8054;&#957; &#7952;&#948;&#941;&#958;&#945;&#964;&#959; &#948;&#945;&#8150;&#964;&#945; &#960;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#942;&#964;&#959;&#965;</span>.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="238" id="page238"></a>AMBROSE (&#8224;397), in his Commentary in <i>Ep. ad Rom. I. 23</i>, writes,
&quot;<span xml:lang="la">Coluerunt et serpentem draconem quem occidit Daniel, homo dei</span>&quot; (Basel,
1527, IV. p. 768).</p>

<p>CHRYSOSTOM (&#8224;407), <i>In Danielem</i>, cap. XIII. (XIV.) comments on Bel and
the Dragon as part of the book, seemingly without reserve or alteration
of tone.</p>

<p>PRUDENTIUS (&#8224;410), in his <i>Cathemerinon</i>, IV., has several verses on the
den episode, of which this is one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p xml:lang="la">&quot;Cernit forte procul dapes ineuntas<br />
Quas messoribus Habakkuk propheta<br />
Agresti bonus exhibebat arte.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>JEROME (&#8224;420), though excluding this and the other Additions from the
canon, according to what he writes in his preface to Daniel, &quot;<span xml:lang="la">veru
anteposito easque jugulante subjecimus</span>,&quot; retains it in his Bible. In his
<i>Onomasticon de Nominibus Hebraicis</i> he includes under Daniel, Astyages,
Bel, Ambacum, without distinction from the rest of the names in Daniel.
But for this last work he was chiefly indebted to Eusebius, <span xml:lang="el">&#928;&#949;&#964;&#8054; &#964;&#8182;&#957;
&#959;&#960;&#953;&#954;&#8182;&#957; &#8000;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;</span>. (<i>D.C.B.</i> II. 336a).</p>

<p>HESYCHIUS OF JERUSALEM (&#8224;438), in his <span xml:lang="el">&#931;&#964;&#953;&#967;&#951;&#961;&#972;&#957;</span> on the XII prophets, says
of Habakkuk that, whether <a class="pagenum" title="239" id="page239"></a>he was the same Habakkuk as an angel carried
to Babylon, <span xml:lang="el">&#949;&#7984;&#960;&#949;&#8150;&#957; &#964;&#8056; &#963;&#945;&#966;&#8050;&#962; &#959;&#8016;&#954; &#7956;&#967;&#969;</span>.</p>

<p>THEODORET(&#8224;457), towards the close of <i>Ep.</i> CXLV., quotes v. 36 with
clear belief in the miracle. He also comments on vv. 1, 2 as if forming
v. 14 of Dan. xii.; and then ceases.</p>

<p>We see, then, that the more than respectful references to this piece in
the writers of ancient Christendom, if not quite so frequent as the
citations of the Song and of Susanna, are still numerous and clear.</p>

<h5>Art.</h5>

<p>This apocryphal tract has afforded two fairly popular subjects for
artistic illustration, viz., Daniel destroying the dragon, and Daniel
and Habakkuk in the lions' den.</p>

<p>Daniel destroying the Dragon is a subject represented on glass from the
catacombs (<i>D.C.A.</i> art. <i>Glass</i>, p. 733a). Garrucci (<i>Vetri</i>, XIII.
13) has a glass vessel in which Christ is represented with Daniel, who
is giving cakes to the dragon (<i>D.C.A. Jesus Christ, Representations
of</i>, p. 877b). In <i>Paganism in Christian Art</i> in the same Dictionary
(p. 1535a), it is said, &quot;Hercules feeding the fabled dragon with cakes
of poppy-seed appears to have furnished the motive for the
representation of the <a class="pagenum" title="240" id="page240"></a>apocryphal story of Daniel killing the dragon at
Babylon.&quot; Presumably this means the dragon Ladon in the garden of the
Hesperides. But the connection between the two dragon episodes of
Hercules and Daniel seems a little difficult to establish by
indisputable evidence.</p>

<p>In Walter Lowrie's <i>Christian Art and Arch&aelig;ology</i> (Lond. and New York,
1901, p. 363) is a woodcut of a fragment of gold glass, with Daniel
slaying the Dragon. This is correctly described on p. 209, but is
wrongly entitled under the figure itself, as 'Daniel slaying Bel.' The
picture is said to be taken from Garrucci, <i>Storia dell' Arte</i>, but no
further reference is given. On p. 365 of Lowrie's book is a smaller
scene of the same in glass, again with an erroneous description on p.
xxi. as &quot;Daniel and Bel.&quot; No dates are suggested for the above pieces of
glass, but they appear to be very ancient.</p>

<p>In the Vatican cemetery a representation of Daniel's destruction of the
dragon has been found on a sarcophagus; nor is this a solitary instance.
(<i>See O.T. in Art, D.C.A.</i> p. 1459a.) And on the south side of the
Angel Choir in Lincoln Minster, among a series of sculptures in the
spandrils of the triforium arches, occurs a figure, described by
Cockerell, the architect, as that of the &quot;Angel of Daniel,&quot; with <a class="pagenum" title="241" id="page241"></a>a
monster under his feet, deemed to be &quot;the old Dragon &quot; (Arch&aelig;ol.
Institute's <i>Memoirs of Lincoln</i>, Lond. 1850, p. 222).</p>

<p>Habakkuk with the loaves often appears in representations of the lions'
den (<i>O.T. in Art</i>, 1459a). In fact there is reason to think that this
apocryphal scene was at least as frequently represented as the
corresponding canonical one; <i>e.g.</i> on a sarcophagus at Rome figured in
the frontispiece to Burgon's <i>Letters from Rome</i>, thought by him to be
of about the 5th century (p. 244). There is also a woodcut of this in
<i>D.C.A.</i> art. <i>Sculpture</i>, p. 1868. A sarcophagus of the 4th century
also, like Burgon's, in the Lateran Museum (though not, it would seem,
identical) is mentioned in W. Lowrie's <i>Art and Arch&aelig;ology</i>, p. 260, as
carved with the same subject of Daniel and Habakkuk.</p>

<p>In Bohn's edition of Didron's <i>Christian Iconography</i> (Lond. 1886, II.
210) there is a woodcut of a miniature in the <i>Speculum hum. salv.</i>
(<i>circ.</i> 1350), in the library of Lord Coleridge, portraying Daniel
among the lions. The appearance of Habakkuk guided by the angel in the
background, carrying food, identifies the scene with Bel and the Dragon,
and not with the history of Dan. vi. Even in representations of this,
the canonical den-scene, it is <a class="pagenum" title="242" id="page242"></a>noteworthy how often Daniel is shown in
a sitting posture, although all mention of this is confined to v. 40 of
the apocryphal story.</p>

<p>It is a little remarkable that Daniel's dramatic disclosure of the
priests' trick (v. 21) has not, so far as the writer is aware, commended
itself to artists. The ash-strewn floor of Bel's temple, the tell-tale
footmarks, and the emotions of exultation and surprise on the face of
Daniel and the King respectively, with a possible introduction of the
detected impostors at the side, might make, in capable hands, a very
effective picture.</p>
</div>

<div id="part4_12" class="section">
<h4>&quot;Example Of Life And Instruction Of Manners.&quot;</h4>

<p>The whole story, in addition to proving the vanity of idols, shews how
God watches over the fate of those who bravely discharge his work; while
idolaters and persecutors meet with punishment. Religious fraud, deceit
under mask of piety, is dealt with very severely. Retribution is not to
be escaped. Even J.M. Fuller (S.P.C.K. <i>Comm. Introd.</i>), who regards the
story as &quot;essentially apocryphal,&quot; admits &quot;an edifying element.&quot;<a id="fnt84" href="#fn84"><sup>[84]</sup></a>.
This element might <a class="pagenum" title="243" id="page243"></a>perhaps be used with advantage more than it is by
missionaries to idolatrous peoples.</p>

<div id="fn84" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt84">[84]</a> It was told as a story to Miss Yonge when a child by her father
(<i>Life</i>, 1903, p. 78), and apparently remembered with pleasure through
life. So Saml. Johnson: &quot;When I was a boy I have read or heard Bel and
the Dragon, Susanna, etc.&quot; (<i>Prayers and Meditations</i>, Lond. [1905], p.
78).</p>
</div>

<p>The sordidness and trickery of heathen priests<a id="fnt85" href="#fn85"><sup>[85]</sup></a> is contrasted with
the uprightness and single-minded devotion of Daniel. His God moreover
delivers him, but their gods do not deliver them. The Bel of this
history is as dumb as the Baal of I. Kings xviii.; their names and
characters quite agree.</p>

<div id="fn85" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt85">[85]</a> So Butler in his <i>Hudibras</i> of the Presbyterian Assembly of
Divines:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Bell (<i>sic</i>) and the Dragon's chaplains were<br />
More moderate than those by far.&quot;&mdash;(I. III. 1181).</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<p>The once flourishing temples of iniquity are conspicuously brought to
nought, affording a lesson of confidence and patience to those who fear
the Lord. Thus the angry opponents, who made certain of slaying Daniel,
were disappointed, and judgment quickly overtook them.</p>

<p>With v. 6 Arnald, <i>in loc.</i>, finely contrasts the P.B.V. of Ps. xvi.
2&mdash;the God who was estimated by the amount of provisions he consumed,
and the God to whom earthly goods were nothing. But the Hebrew will
hardly bear the P.B.V. rendering.</p>

<p>The character of Daniel, without fear or reproach, is not out of keeping
with that displayed in the canonical book, and in the companion story of
Susanna. He affords an example of:</p>

<p>(a) <i>Courage</i> in his fearless attacks upon idolatry, <a class="pagenum" title="244" id="page244"></a>attacks which,
as the event proved, could not be indulged in with safety. He faces
terrible crises at much personal risk, with decision and absence of
self-distrust, as in the canonical chapters and in Susanna. He boldly
defends his religion when it is called in question, and ousts rival
worships.</p>

<p>(b) <i>Resistance to temptation</i> in refusing to worship as the king
wished. No half compliance is suggested, such as worshipping Bel and God
together. Observe how he claims for God to be <span xml:lang="el">&#964;&#8056;&#957; &#950;&#8182;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#920;&#949;&#972;&#957;</span>, while
Cyrus only claims for Bel to be <span xml:lang="el">&#950;&#8182;&#957; &#920;&#949;&#972;&#962;</span> (vv. 5, 6, &#920;), as noticed
under 'Theology.'</p>

<p>(c) <i>Wisdom</i>, 'of the serpent,' in his plan for detecting fraud, and
in his skill and versatility in choosing suitable means for unveiling
each kind of imposture; of which another striking instance occurs in
Susanna. He was a man of right understanding, clear insight, and
practical sagacity, as shewn by his methods of dealing with opposing
forces, moral or physical. As a man of great resource he rapidly adapts
himself to fresh conditions.</p>

<p>(d) <i>Endurance</i> of persecution for righteousness' sake. One trial
overcome, a yet greater presents itself; but with unflinching constancy
he faces it and passes unharmed, Ps. lvii. 3, 4.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" title="245" id="page245"></a>(e) <i>Perseverance</i>, in not resting upon his laurels, won over Bel,
but proceeding against the Dragon. His promptitude of resource is not
mere rashness, but is combined with steady determination in pursuing his
task. As an active and diligent worker he is far-sighted and firm of
purpose.</p>

<p>(f) <i>Gratitude.</i> On receiving Habakkuk's visit he at once acknowledges
God's faithfulness, and addresses himself to the great First Cause
immediately (v. 38), as the ever-watchful shaper of events.</p>

<p>(g) <i>Mindfulness of faith and duty</i>, by being ever foremost, even in
association with a heathen king whose eyes he opens and to whom he acts
as a missionary, in shewing hatred of falsehood and love of truth (as in
Susanna). Absence of selfishness and willingness to undertake
responsibility are manifested.</p>

<p>(h) <i>Disinterested service</i> of God in clearing away two great
obstacles to his worship. His aims are realised without any trace of
self-aggrandisement; for those aims are directed to his Maker's rather
than to his own glory.</p>

<p>(i) <i>Pleasure in God's service.</i> The tone of the whole story
implicitly conveys the idea that Daniel enjoyed, and was happy in the
achievement of these works, because they were designed to honour God
<a class="pagenum" title="246" id="page246"></a>and to benefit man. Thus he finds his tasks thoroughly interesting and
congenial.</p>

<p>It is to be observed that Daniel's character is in contrast with that of
everyone in the story, except Habakkuk.</p>

<p><i>Per contra</i>, Daniel might perhaps be accused of cruelty in his method
of slaying the dragon,<a id="fnt86" href="#fn86"><sup>[86]</sup></a> especially as described in Gaster's Aramaic,
and by Josippon ben Gorion, given by Arnald, <i>in loc.</i>, from Selden.</p>

<div id="fn86" class="note">
<p><a href="#fnt86">[86]</a> J.H. Blunt (<i>Comm.</i> on v. 27) makes an unaccountable mistake
in
supposing that the balls were put into the <i>statue</i> of Bel, not eaten by
the Dragon. &quot;The composition would not of itself burst the hollow statue
either by chymical explosion or mechanical expansion.&quot; Almost as
ridiculous is the abusive phrase &quot;Offspring of Bel and the Dragon,&quot;
which Congreve puts into the mouth of Fondlewife in his play of <i>The Old
Bachelor</i>, Act IV. sc. 4.</p>
</div>

<p>In Habakkuk we see <i>obedience to</i> a divine command, apparently
impossible of execution, for which the way is suddenly made plain. He
becomes instrumental in alleviating such a state of affairs as he
deplores in i. 4 of his Prophecy: &quot;for the wicked doth compass about the
righteous, etc.&quot; So in the hymn &quot;<span xml:lang="de">Warum betr&uuml;bst du dich mein Herz?</span>&quot;
doubtfully attributed to Hans Sachs, we find the seventh stanza bearing
upon this matter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p xml:lang="de">Des Daniels Gott ihm nicht rergass,<br />
Da er unter den L&ouml;wen sass:<br />
Sein Engel sandt er hin,<br />
Und liess ihm Speise bringen gut,<br />
Durch seiner Diener Habakkuk.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Habakkuk's obedience served God's purpose.</p>

<p>In <i>Cyrus'</i> character we see something of the <a class="pagenum" title="247" id="page247"></a>impulsiveness of the
despotic monarch, giving hasty directions on the spur of the moment as
to matters of much importance. But the events of the story exert an
educative influence upon his mind, culminating in his sentiments as
expressed in v. 41, which apparently imply that Daniel's God was to be
his God. Certainly the monarch's testimony proves that his religious
opinions had been corrected, and raised above the stage represented in
v. 6.</p>

<p>Probably some allegoric, or more strictly 'tropological,' instruction
may be drawn from the story. In Bel we are taught to fight against
crafty deception however generally believed in; in the Dragon, against
fierce, repulsive, and terrifying adversaries. This kind of
interpretation is sometimes strained however, as when in Neale's edition
of the <i>Moral Concordances</i> of St. Antony of Padua (p. 125, n.d.), v. 27
is given as applicable to St. Bartholomew.</p>

<p>An unexpectedly adverse opinion on the use of Bel and the Dragon as a
lesson (Nov. 23, matins, old Lectionary) is expressed by J.H. Blunt in
his <i>Directorium Pastorale</i> (1864, p. 59): &quot;I confess I can see no good
which can arise from the public <a class="pagenum" title="248" id="page248"></a>reading to a congregation, composed
principally perhaps of young persons, of such lessons as Bel and the
Dragon, or Lev. xviii., Deut. xxii., xxv.&quot; Then he adds the following
curious note: &quot;It is a fact that a man was once sent into a fit of loud
and uncontrollable laughter, although he was honestly preparing for holy
orders, by hearing this lesson (Bel and the Dragon) read for the first
time in the chapel of a Theological College.&quot; One cannot help thinking
that this gentleman must have had an abnormally developed sense of
humour under exceptionally bad control.</p>

<p>John Wesley exhibits in his Journal (July 5th, 1773) an equally low
opinion of the story, though free from ill-timed mirth: &quot;St. Patrick
converting 30,000 at one sermon I rank with the History of Bel and the
Dragon&quot; (Quoted in <i>Church Quarterly Review</i>, Jan. 1902, p. 323).</p>

<p>These opinions seem too contemptuous and inimical to a narrative which
yields many valuable lessons. Indeed it may be said of this, as in the
Bishops' reply at the Savoy Conference to the Puritan objection to
reading the Apocryphal lessons in general: &quot;It is heartily to be wished
that sermons were as good&quot; (Procter-Frere, <i>Hist. of P.B.</i> 1902, p.
174).</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

Gutenberg-tm License.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
